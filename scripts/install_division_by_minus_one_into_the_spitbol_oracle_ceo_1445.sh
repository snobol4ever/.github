# m = -9223372036854775807 - 1, every overflow agrees between sbl and SCRIP (m - 1 ERROR 34, -m 11, m * -1 28, n + 1 3) EXCEPT that
# m / -1 and REMDR(m, -1) kill sbl with SIGFPE (rc 136; CSNOBOL4 dies the same way): int.dcl's do_dvi and do_rmi test only for a zero
# divisor before idiv, and x86 idiv faults (#DE) when the quotient overflows. sbl.min's own design wants an overflow there -- s_rmd checks
# iov after rmi (ERROR 167) and division iov is ERROR 14 -- so the cure is one test before each idiv: a divisor of -1 negates (do_dvi;
# neg sets OF exactly for the smallest integer, so m / -1 is ERROR 14) or leaves remainder 0 (do_rmi; exact for every integer, no
# overflow). SCRIP already answers ERROR 14 and 0, so after this swap the two agree on every case.

# WHY LON RUNS IT: every write under /home/resources is refused to the ceo seat by the harness classifier (Modify Shared Resources).
# Run it as:   ! bash .github/scripts/install_division_by_minus_one_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1445.sh       (--dry-run stops after step 3)
#
# WHAT IT DOES, and nothing else:
#   1 refuses unless the fork is clean at 9a70e79 (ORD and pipes) with the installed bin/sbl md5 5bd72ede..., the binary the ceo measured;
#   2 copies the fork to a temp dir, applies the 15 lines of int.dcl below, rebuilds, and refuses unless the build's md5 is the one the
#     ceo built twice (9285c385...): the build is deterministic;
#   3 runs the division witness on the new build and refuses unless it prints the measured answers;
#   4 installs: a UTC-stamped backup bin/sbl.bak-<stamp>, then the new binary by atomic rename (a grader already running keeps the old one);
#   5 commits int.dcl and bin/sbl in the fork and pushes; appends one paragraph to ORACLES.md (insertion only, with a .bak).
# CENSUS (the ceo, 581 corpus SNOBOL4 programs -- packages, benchmarks, demos; stdin the program's .in or /dev/null, 10 s; old against
# new): 574 identical; the other 7 (gimpel timegc_driver, timer_driver, poker_driver, snoflake recursive-yz-pattern, gimpel-day-of-week,
# gimpel-random-poem, x64 gcbuster) differ old against old too, or match on a rerun -- timing, the clock, random seeds.
# Exit: 0 done · 1 a step failed after the install began · 2 REFUSED, nothing installed.

Division and REMDR by -1 no longer die of SIGFPE on the smallest integer: do_dvi negates, do_rmi leaves 0

Lon 2026-10-02, in-chat to the ceo: "Have lowest intger also so - 1 will do overflow." (ceo CEO-1445)
With m = -9223372036854775807 - 1, m / -1 and REMDR(m, -1) killed sbl with SIGFPE (rc 136): do_dvi and do_rmi tested only
for a zero divisor before idiv, and x86 idiv faults when the quotient overflows. A divisor of -1 now negates in do_dvi (neg
sets OF exactly for the smallest integer, so m / -1 is ERROR 14, as sbl.min's iov wants) and leaves remainder 0 in do_rmi
(exact for every integer). Witness: m / -1 ERROR 14, REMDR(m, -1) 0, 7 / -1 -7, m / 0 ERROR 14, REMDR(m, 0) ERROR 167.
Census: old vs new over 581 corpus SNOBOL4 programs: 574 identical, 7 differ old vs old too or match on a rerun.
