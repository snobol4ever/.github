# check_sbl_trace_and_folding.sh [sbl]  -- ceo 2026-09-05 (CEO-282): the SPITBOL oracle's OWN self-test for row
# snobol4-oracle-sbl-trace-dispatch-constants-fixed-in-the-fork-and-swapped (hq_B's four acceptance tests, the two computable here).
# rc 0 = the binary traces TRACE(X,'VALUE') AND TRACE(Y,'value') under -bf AND still folds names under -b (abc==ABC prints 5);
# rc 1 = one arm red (today: the x64 fork refuses every trace type with ERROR 199); rc 2 = cannot measure. ⛔ The -b arm is the oracle's
# folding self-test on the oracle itself, never a grading arm for SCRIP (RULES.md: programs are graded under -bf, always).
#
# MERGED 2026-09-05 by hq_B (the ceo and hq_B wrote this file concurrently; both versions kept their best half).
# ⭐ KEPT FROM THE ceo: all three arms are REPORTED, and rc accumulates -- the script never exits on the first red.
# That matters more than it looks: the two halves of this check fail INDEPENDENTLY, and "which arms are red" is the
# whole diagnosis. Exiting early would hide the folding arm behind the trace arm and vice versa.
#
# ⛔⭐ ADDED BY hq_B, TWO MEASURED TRAPS THAT BOTH LIVE IN THE OBVIOUS SPELLING OF THIS CHECK:
# (1) NO BARE `grep` ON A STDIN PIPE. Claude Code's shell injects a `grep` FUNCTION that silently misreads
#     `cmd | grep pattern` when there is no file argument -- empty/wrong instead of an error (seat01, 2026-09-05,
#     after it false-REFUSED a DONE-WHEN twice). Every match here is `command grep` against a FILE.
# (2) `&TRACE` MUST BE NONZERO OR NOTHING TRACES, on any binary, fixed or broken (manual v3.7 p.244). A witness
#     that omits it is SILENT and reads as "still broken" -- reporting RED at the exact moment the repair
#     succeeded. The version inlined in this row's DONE-WHEN omitted it; measured on the fixed build, without
#     `&TRACE` the program prints nothing and with it prints `****4*******  X = 1`. Fix the DONE-WHEN too.
#
# ⭐ WHY ALL THREE ARMS BELONG IN ONE SCRIPT: no build on this box passed both halves before the repair -- x64
# folded names and refused every trace type; stock traced and its &CASE folding was a silent no-op. Checking
# either half alone PASSES a binary that is broken in the other, which is exactly how this went unnoticed.
