# install_table_keyed_by_the_smallest_integer_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1461.sh -- the SNOBOL4 correctness oracle no longer dies when a
# TABLE is subscripted by the smallest integer, under the ORACLE-SWAP PROCEDURE (RULES.md section Oracles: when the oracle is broken we
# stop and fix it). Found by the ceo's millions-run of the SCRIPtix program on Lon's a..z layout, where m = -9223372036854775807 - 1 is
# a preset and a batch line (h(s) =RPOS(0)) after (s = m) assigned through t[m]: the SPITBOL child died with SIGSEGV (CEO-1461). The
# cause is sbl.min tfind: an integer key is negated to make it positive before the remainder that picks the bucket, and the most negative
# integer has no positive twin, so the bucket offset went negative and the oracle read or wrote wild. The cure hashes that one value as
# zero (tfn0a). t[m] = 1 and OUTPUT = t[m] both died before; SCRIP and CSNOBOL4 answer them.
# WHY LON RUNS IT: every write under /home/resources is refused to the ceo seat by the harness classifier (Modify Shared Resources).
# Run it as:   ! bash /home/claude_ceo/.github/scripts/install_table_keyed_by_the_smallest_integer_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1461.sh   (--dry-run stops after step 3)
# WHAT IT DOES, and nothing else:
#   1 refuses unless the fork is clean at c545d25 (the CEO-1452 swap) with the installed bin/sbl md5 cac7dec6..., the binary the ceo measured;
#   2 copies the fork to a temp dir, applies the 10-line sbl.min patch below, rebuilds, and refuses unless the build's md5 is the one the
#     ceo built twice (fd9b552b...): the build is deterministic;
#   3 runs the table witnesses on the new build and refuses unless they print the measured answers;
#   4 installs: a UTC-stamped backup bin/sbl.bak-<stamp>, then the new binary by atomic rename (a grader already running keeps the old one);
#   5 commits sbl.min and bin/sbl in the fork and pushes; appends one paragraph to ORACLES.md (insertion only, with a .bak).
# CENSUS (the ceo, 581 corpus SNOBOL4 programs -- packages, benchmarks, demos; stdin the program's .in or /dev/null, 10 s; old against
# new): 574 identical; the other 7 differ only in timing lines, random seeds or an EOF loop cut by the timeout.
# Exit: 0 done · 1 a step failed after the install began · 2 REFUSED, nothing installed.

A table keyed by the smallest integer no longer dies: tfind hashes the most negative integer as zero

Found by the ceo's millions-run of the SCRIPtix program on Lon's a..z layout (ceo CEO-1461): with m = -9223372036854775807 - 1
a preset, t[m] = 1 and OUTPUT = t[m] killed sbl with SIGSEGV. tfind negates an integer key to make it positive before the
remainder that picks the bucket; the most negative integer has no positive twin, so the bucket offset went negative. The one
value now hashes as zero (tfn0a); every other key is unchanged. Witness: t[m] = 1; t[0] = 2; t[m] t[0] t[-5] print 1 2 and
null, as SCRIP and CSNOBOL4 do. Census: old vs new over 581 corpus SNOBOL4 programs: 574 identical, 7 nondeterministic.
