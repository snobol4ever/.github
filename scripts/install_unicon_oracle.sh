# install_unicon_oracle.sh -- build Unicon as the THIRD Icon oracle, beside Arizona icont/iconx and jcon.
# Lon 2026-09-11, in-chat to ceo: "Let's make Unicon a third oracle for our Icon testing and performance
# benchmarks." (CEO-568). Staged for LON TO RUN: the ceo may not build or install under /home/resources
# (the harness classifier refuses it), so this script exists to be run as:  ! bash .github/scripts/install_unicon_oracle.sh
#
# ⛔ THIS IS AN *ADD*, NOT AN ORACLE SWAP. No existing oracle binary is touched, moved or rebuilt. The
# ORACLE-SWAP PROCEDURE (RULES.md § Oracles) governs replacing a shared oracle and does not apply here;
# what does apply is the broadcast and the re-baseline, because a new rival appears in benchmark grids.
# Arizona icont/iconx 9.5.25a REMAINS THE ICON BASELINE (CEO-390: one Icon oracle, one feature set).
# Unicon is a SUPERSET language with its own compiler and runtime -- it accepts programs icont refuses
# (measured: 16 of 26 Benchmarks Game entries), so it can never define what Icon IS for us. Its two jobs:
#   (1) PERFORMANCE RIVAL -- a third engine in Icon benchmark grids beside iconx and SCRIP.
#   (2) CORRECTNESS CROSS-CHECK -- a second opinion where a .std is ambiguous or where our reading of
#       icont's behaviour is the thing in doubt. A disagreement between Unicon and icont is a FINDING to
#       route, never a baseline change. ⛔ If Unicon and icont disagree, ICONT WINS, and the divergence
#       is recorded with both outputs.

NEXT, and none of it is this script's to do:
  1. ceo adds the ICON ORACLE row to /home/resources/ORACLES.md naming this path, its role as
     RIVAL + CROSS-CHECK, and that Arizona icont remains the baseline.
  2. a seat adds unicon_bin() to SCRIP/scripts/lib_oracle_flags.sh beside icont_bin()/iconx_bin(),
     so no script ever assembles this path from memory (the one-path-segment trap, ORACLES.md).
  3. the coo re-baselines Icon benchmark grids with the third arm present; grids gain a column,
     they are NOT re-stamped -- existing numbers keep their own tree labels.
