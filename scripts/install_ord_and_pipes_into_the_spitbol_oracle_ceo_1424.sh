# install_ord_and_pipes_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1424.sh -- compile ORD into our SPITBOL fork AND cure its ! command pipes, and swap
# the build in as the SNOBOL4 correctness oracle,
# under the ORACLE-SWAP PROCEDURE (RULES.md section Oracles). Lon 2026-10-02, in-chat to the ceo: "Add the ORD function." and "Finish ORD
# and test6." (ceo CEO-1415); and on the pipes: "I'm hoping we have the "!process" file I/O fake-out sub-process." and "You could use that
# instead of IPC COMM's. Better DEMO since it straight SNOBOL4 feature." (ceo CEO-1424). SUPERSEDES install_ord_into_the_spitbol_oracle_
# ceo_1415.sh, which was never run: one swap carries both changes.
# THE PIPE DEFECT (upstream 4.0f's too, measured on spitbol-pristine and the bench oracle): every INPUT/OUTPUT association whose file is
# !<delim>command reads EOF at once and writes nowhere, because the forked child dies with SIGSEGV before execl: osint/getshell.c calls
# findenv(SHELL_ENV_NAME, sizeof(SHELL_ENV_NAME)), sizeof counts the NUL, so make_c_str stores a NUL one byte past the string literal
# "SHELL", in read-only memory (gdb in the child: make_c_str <- findenv <- getshell <- doshell <- ospipe <- osopen). The cure is
# sizeof(...) - 1, which points make_c_str at the literal's own NUL, where it writes nothing. No graded corpus program opens a pipe
# (packages, tests, benchmarks, demos, include, library: 0); the 23 users are under programs/lon_cherryholmes, which no suite grades.
#
# WHY LON RUNS IT: every write under /home/resources is refused to the ceo seat by the harness classifier (Modify Shared Resources); the
# 2026-09-05 swap was a one-line ! bash for the same reason. Run it as:   ! bash .github/scripts/install_ord_and_pipes_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1424.sh
#
# WHAT IT DOES, and nothing else:
#   1 refuses unless the fork is clean at 012d00e (SET) with the installed bin/sbl md5 ffda07f4..., the binary the ceo measured against;
#   2 copies the fork to a temp dir, applies ORD's 19 lines of sbl.min (below) and the one-line getshell.c cure, rebuilds, and refuses unless
#     the build's md5 is the one the ceo built twice and measured (5bd72ede...): the build is deterministic;
#   3 runs the ORD witness and the pipe witness on the new build and refuses unless both print the measured answers;
#   4 installs: a UTC-stamped backup bin/sbl.bak-<stamp>, then the new binary by atomic rename (a grader already running keeps the old one),
#     and the patched sbl.min;
#   5 commits sbl.min, osint/getshell.c and bin/sbl in the fork and pushes; appends one paragraph to ORACLES.md (insertion only, with a .bak).
# WHAT ORD IS: ORD(S) is the character code of S's first character, S taken as a string (an integer converts first: ORD(65) is 54), and it
# fails when S is null -- CSNOBOL4's ORD, the reference for the feature. Declared svfnn, not svfnp: a preevaluated function "must never cause
# failure", and ORD fails on null (svfnp gave ERROR 299 at compile time on ORD('')). A non-string argument is ERROR 333 "ord argument is not a
# string", the first unused number after 332.
# CENSUS (the ceo, 730 corpus SNOBOL4 programs, stdin /dev/null, 20 s, old against new): 717 identical; csnobol4_suite/ord.sno and
# snoflake_suite/csnobol4-extensions.sno change (they call ORD); the other 11 differ old against old too, or only in the post-mortem's
# execution-time line (timing, ASLR, EOF loops cut by the timeout).
# Usage: bash install_ord_and_pipes_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1424.sh [--dry-run]     (--dry-run stops after step 3)

ORD compiled in, and ! command pipes carry data again: getshell's findenv length counted the NUL

Lon 2026-10-02, in-chat to the ceo: "I'm hoping we have the "!process" file I/O fake-out sub-process." (ceo CEO-1424)
PIPES: every INPUT/OUTPUT association on !<delim>command read EOF at once and wrote nowhere, upstream 4.0f too: the forked
child died with SIGSEGV before execl, because getshell passed findenv sizeof(SHELL_ENV_NAME), which counts the NUL, and
make_c_str stored a NUL one byte past the literal "SHELL" in read-only memory. sizeof(...) - 1 points it at the literal's
own NUL, where it writes nothing. Witness: INPUT(.X, 8, '!*echo hello') reads hello; OUTPUT(.Y, 9, '!*cat > f') writes f;
a SPITBOL parent reads a SPITBOL child's answers through '!*sbl -bf eval.sno < batch'. No graded corpus program opens a pipe.

ORD(S): the character code of S's first character, S taken as a string, failing on null -- CSNOBOL4's ORD

Lon 2026-10-02, in-chat to the ceo: "Add the ORD function." and "Finish ORD and test6." (ceo CEO-1415)
v_ord in the three-character svblk list between LNE and POS, declared svfnn (fast call, NO preevaluation: a preevaluated
function must never fail, and ORD fails on null -- svfnp gave ERROR 299 at compile time on ORD('')); s_ord takes its
argument through gtstg, fails on a zero length, loads the first character, clears xr, and exits through exint.
ERROR 333 "ord argument is not a string" is the first number unused after 332.
Witness, byte-identical to csnobol4 -b: ORD('A')=65, ORD('AB')=65, ORD(CHAR(0))=0, ORD(CHAR(255))=255, ORD(CHAR(128))=128,
ORD(65)=54, ORD(1.5)=49, DATATYPE INTEGER, ORD('') fails, all 256 CHAR(I) round trips; ORD(ARRAY(1)) is ERROR 333.
Census: old vs new over 730 corpus SNOBOL4 programs (packages, benchmarks, demos, programs; stdin /dev/null, 20 s): 717 identical;
csnobol4_suite/ord.sno and snoflake_suite/csnobol4-extensions.sno change (they call ORD); 11 differ old-vs-old too or only in the
post-mortem's execution time. An unchanged rebuild reproduced the installed bin/sbl byte for byte (md5 ffda07f4) before the edit.
