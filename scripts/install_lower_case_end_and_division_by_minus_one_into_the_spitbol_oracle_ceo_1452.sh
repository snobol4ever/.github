# install_lower_case_end_and_division_by_minus_one_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1452.sh -- TWO cures in the SNOBOL4 correctness oracle, one
# swap, under the ORACLE-SWAP PROCEDURE (RULES.md section Oracles). SUPERSEDES install_division_by_minus_one_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1445.sh,
# which was never run: both patches sit on fork commit 9a70e79, and one swap carries both.
# (1) Lon 2026-10-03, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "So fix the SPITBOL oracle to accept END as upper-case, and end as lower-case." and
#     "Ensure that SCRIP only accepts upper-case END." (ceo CEO-1452). Under -f the end statement was found only by the predefined
#     variable END (v_end); sbl.min gains a second system-label block v_enl spelled end beside it, and the label scan (cmp07) accepts
#     either, so a program ending in end runs and :(end) ends it; End stays an ordinary label; a VARIABLE named end is unchanged
#     (end = 5 still assigns). SCRIP keeps accepting only END -- a ruled divergence, so a vendored CSNOBOL4 program ending in end runs
#     under the oracle (the 32 the corpus holds were made END at corpus 733e90de3 anyway).
# (2) Lon 2026-10-02: "Have lowest intger also so - 1 will do overflow." (ceo CEO-1445). With m = -9223372036854775807 - 1, m / -1 and
#     REMDR(m, -1) killed sbl with SIGFPE (int.dcl's do_dvi and do_rmi tested only a zero divisor before idiv): a divisor of -1 now
#     negates (ERROR 14 on the smallest integer) or leaves remainder 0, as SCRIP already answers.
# WHY LON RUNS IT: every write under /home/resources is refused to the ceo seat by the harness classifier (Modify Shared Resources).
# Run it as:   ! bash .github/scripts/install_lower_case_end_and_division_by_minus_one_into_the_spitbol_oracle_ceo_1452.sh   (--dry-run stops after step 3)
# WHAT IT DOES, and nothing else:
#   1 refuses unless the fork is clean at 9a70e79 with the installed bin/sbl md5 5bd72ede..., the binary the ceo measured against;
#   2 copies the fork to a temp dir, applies the patch below (sbl.min 8 lines, int.dcl 15 lines), rebuilds, and refuses unless the build's
#     md5 is the one the ceo built twice (cac7dec6...): the build is deterministic;
#   3 runs the end witnesses and the division witnesses on the new build and refuses unless they print the measured answers;
#   4 installs: a UTC-stamped backup bin/sbl.bak-<stamp>, then the new binary by atomic rename (a grader already running keeps the old one);
#   5 commits sbl.min, int.dcl and bin/sbl in the fork and pushes; appends one paragraph to ORACLES.md (insertion only, with a .bak).
# CENSUS (the ceo, 581 corpus SNOBOL4 programs -- packages, benchmarks, demos; stdin the program's .in or /dev/null, 10 s; old against
# new): 573 identical; the other 8 are nondeterministic (timing lines, random seeds, Test2's EOF loop cut by the timeout).
# Exit: 0 done · 1 a step failed after the install began · 2 REFUSED, nothing installed.

end in lower case is the end statement beside END; division and REMDR by -1 no longer die of SIGFPE on the smallest integer

Under -f the end statement was found only through the predefined variable END (v_end). A second system-label block v_enl,
spelled end, sits beside it and the label scan at cmp07 accepts either: a program ending in end runs, :(end) ends it, End
stays an ordinary label, and a variable named end is unchanged. SCRIP keeps accepting only END (Lon's word the same hour).
Lon 2026-10-02: "Have lowest intger also so - 1 will do overflow." (ceo CEO-1445)
With m = -9223372036854775807 - 1, m / -1 and REMDR(m, -1) killed sbl with SIGFPE: int.dcl's do_dvi and do_rmi tested only
a zero divisor before idiv. A divisor of -1 now negates in do_dvi (OF on the smallest integer -> ERROR 14) and leaves
remainder 0 in do_rmi, as SCRIP already answers.
