    """⛔⭐ A LANE THAT HAS DECLARED ITS CONFIGURATION MAY NEVER SILENTLY STOP, AND NO WRITER MAY STILL BE
    EMITTING THE OLD WIDTH.

    THE HOLE THIS CLOSES, quoted from the writer it closes it around. util_progress_append.py refuses an
    undeclared row in exactly ONE case: when a GC axis is set IN ITS OWN PROCESS ENVIRONMENT. That refusal is
    correct and it is also bounded, and the writer's own comment says why -- "the runner may set the axis
    per-child, so an empty environment here is an ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE about the child". A runner that forks its
    children with SCRIP_GC_STRESS set and then appends from a clean parent meets no refusal at all. So the
    undeclared population can grow forever and the writer's guard can never fire on it. That is the ratchet's
    subject, and it is judged HERE, against the long-lived table, because that is the only place the defect
    exists -- a gate that builds its subject fresh under mktemp cannot see it (the fifteen-day `fingerprint`
    blindness is the proof).

    THREE ARMS AND A FLOOR:
      A  SHORT ROWS -- a row appended at or after the baseline carrying FEWER COLUMNS than the header names.
         This is the exact shape that hid `fingerprint` inside 3.58M rows for fifteen days while its own gate
         stayed green. 13610 such rows were appended earlier on the baseline's own day.
      B  DECLARATION REGRESSION -- a (measurer, suite) pair that HAS declared a real configuration at or after
         the baseline and later appended `undeclared` anyway. Absence is tolerated; REGRESSION is not.
      FLOOR  zero rows at or after the baseline is REFUSE(2), never green: an instrument that reports success
         while doing nothing is the recurring failure (RULES.md INSTRUMENT LAWS).

    ⛔ WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, AND THE NUMBER THAT DECIDED IT: it does not red a lane that has
    NEVER declared. On the day it was written exactly ONE measurer had declared a configuration SINCE THE COLUMN
    EXISTED -- hq_snocone, 12096 rows -- and the other nine had not. ⛔ BOUNDED IN PLACE 2026-09-21 BY THE ceo
    (CEO-1060) AND THE BOUND IS RIGHT: the `config` column did not EXIST before 17:53:17Z, so "has ever declared"
    spans THIRTY MINUTES, and a population that could not have contained the thing cannot be evidence that nobody
    does it -- A NULL RESULT BOUNDS THE PROBE, NOT THE THING PROBED. What the number actually establishes is that
    ONE SEAT HAS RUN A BOARD THROUGH THE NEW WRITER AND IT DECLARED CORRECTLY: a working mechanism with a sample
    of one, NOT fleet-wide non-compliance. The design conclusion is UNCHANGED and is if anything stronger -- with
    nine lanes not yet observed at all, a ratchet on ABSENCE would red seats whose behaviour has never been
    measured. A ratchet on ABSENCE would therefore
    have been a fleet-wide red on arrival, and a gate nobody can be green under is turned off rather than
    obeyed. The floor rises one lane at a time, by that lane's own first declaration, and from then on it
    cannot fall. That is what makes it a ratchet rather than a deadline.
