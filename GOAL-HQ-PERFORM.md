# ⛔⭐⭐⭐⭐ GOAL-HQ-PERFORM — HEADQUARTERS FOR **SPEED**

**Opened 2026-08-22 s256 by Lon, in-chat, verbatim in substance:** *"the second HQ for SPEED PERFORMANCE for the same three and the same priority."* · The product promise is **TEN TIMES FASTER**.

**Seat root:** `/home/claude_P` · **postoffice identity:** `hq_P` · **twin:** `GOAL-HQ-COMPLETE.md` (`/home/claude_C`, `hq_C`)

## THE ONE QUESTION THIS HQ OWNS

**How many instructions does it take?** Correctness belongs to `hq_C`. ⛔ But **a wrong answer is never a fast answer**: before any number is published, the program's OUTPUT must be verified. beauty mode-3 emits 278 bytes today instead of 40,971 — timing it would show a spectacular speedup for a program that quits after its header.

| | |
|---|---|
| **priority** | **SNOBOL4 #1 · Icon #2 · Prolog #3** |
| **instrument** | **callgrind Ir at FIXED WORK.** Deterministic, layout-immune, load-immune |
| **oracle** | **`/home/resources/spitbol-clean/sbl`** — the s255 benchmark oracle. ⛔ NEVER time against `x64/bin/sbl`: not because its clock is wrong (HQ measured both at ~1.0e9 ticks/sec, both nanoseconds) but because it is **2.30x handicapped** by monitor hooks |
| **authority** | `scripts/lib_oracle_flags.sh` — `sbl_clean_bin()` for timing, `sbl_lang_flags()` → `-bf` for grading |

## ⛔ THE LAW BOTH HQs SHARE: MEASURE FREELY, CURE NEVER

Build, run, profile, bisect — all of it. **The moment a measurement becomes a DEFECT it becomes a row and a brief, never an edit.**

## ⭐⭐⭐ RUNG P-0 — THE MAP IS ALREADY DRAWN. START FROM IT, DO NOT RE-DERIVE IT

Measured s256, identical fixed work, both engines, `make pristine` EXIT=0 at `2659558e`, **RT_OPT=`-O0`**, SCRIP mode-4 native binary (**compile excluded by construction** — Lon: *"Worry not about compile time. We are zooming on runtime."*):

| workload | Ir/iter SCRIP | Ir/iter SPITBOL | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `var_access` | 529 | 808 | **SCRIP 1.52x FASTER** |
| `arith_loop` | 398 | 439 | **SCRIP 1.10x FASTER** |
| `table_access` | 997,130 | 359,532 | 2.8x slower |
| `string_manip` | 3,123 | 842 | 3.7x slower |
| `roman` | **67,170** | 7,966 | ⛔ **8.4x slower** |
| **beauty runtime** | 2,129,544,838 Ir | 228,082,817 Ir | ⛔ **9.34x slower** |

⭐ **THE SHAPE, AND IT IS THE WHOLE STRATEGY: SCRIP is good at exactly what real programs don't do, and bad at exactly what they do.** Scalar and register-resident work — the BB codegen — genuinely beats SPITBOL. Tables, strings, and whole realistic programs lose by 3–8x.

⭐ **THE 10x IS NOT BLOCKED ON CODEGEN.** Emitted code already wins where measured directly. **Every remaining multiple lives in the RUNTIME SERVICES the emitted code calls out to.** Further box-template tuning improves the one bucket already winning. (⚠️ The older *"emitted code is 0.64% of Ir"* ranking remains true for the compile-dominated m3 beauty measurement it was taken on — it is not the general fact.)

⛔ **`roman` IS THE FIRST TARGET, NOT beauty.** 8.4x and 9.34x are the same program shape (string + pattern + table) giving the same answer; `roman` is far smaller, fixed-work reproducible, and almost certainly shares beauty's dominant cost. Rows: `perf-roman-8x` · `perf-table-array-runtime` · `perf-string-runtime` — all three are **row factories** (rank buckets, mint rows, cure nothing).

## ⛔⛔ HOW TO MEASURE — THE OLD HQ PUBLISHED A WRONG TABLE BY IGNORING THIS

**`harness.inc` has TWO MODES and they answer different questions** (both landed 12:05–12:59 s256, all four oracle×mode cells verified working):

| mode | how | reports | use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TIME** | stdin `/dev/null` | `iters` in a fixed ~500 ms budget | *is it alive* |
| **FIXED-WORK** | stdin = **N** (`fixed_n = INPUT`) | time for exactly N iterations | *is it fast* — pair with callgrind |

1. ⛔ **`ms` IS CONSTANT BY CONSTRUCTION in TIME mode.** HQ's first table read 510–615 ms across fifteen unrelated workloads — that is the `ZBUD` budget, not a result. The real spread hides in `iters`: `arith_loop` 39,845,888 vs `table_access` 3,072, a **13,000x range** behind fifteen identical-looking times. This is the "plausible false table" `bench-harness-unmeasurable` was raised about.
2. ⛔ **TIME-mode `iters` IS UNQUOTABLE ON A LOADED MACHINE.** With 16 seats building, back-to-back runs swung **2x** (`arith_loop` 46,137,344 then 18,874,368) — turning a real **1.10x into a flattering 4.88x**. The wall-clock table said SCRIP was 3–5x faster on its best kernels; deterministic Ir said 1.1–1.5x.
3. ⭐ **EVERY PUBLISHED RATIO MUST BE FIXED-WORK Ir, AND EVERY NUMBER MUST CARRY ITS `RT_OPT`.** O0-DEV-O2-BENCH: `-O0` is the dev default, `-O2` passed explicitly for benchmark runs. A benchmark quoted without its RT_OPT is not comparable.
4. ⛔ **VERIFY THE OUTPUT BEFORE BELIEVING THE NUMBER.**

## WHAT ONE FLEET-DAY ACTUALLY BOUGHT — the honest baseline this HQ inherits

Identical method both ends (9am tree built in an isolated worktree, same fixed work, same callgrind):

| workload | 09:00 | s256 | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **beauty self-host runtime** | 4,811,232,217 | 2,129,544,838 | **2.26x** |
| `roman` | 1,360,546,795 | 1,343,411,963 | **1.01x** |
| `arith_loop` | 79,486,556 | 79,507,515 | **0.99x** |
| `string_manip` | 62,919,777 | 62,457,691 | **1.00x** |

⛔ **One workload moved and every other stayed flat.** The day's gain was `byname-bake-cell-address` (`8c1f2d41`), which cures by-name procedure resolution — beauty does that constantly, the kernels barely at all. ⭐ **THE LESSON THAT JUSTIFIES THIS HQ EXISTING: a fleet optimizing whatever the flagship happens to stress is not a performance campaign.** This seat's job is to make sure the OTHER workloads move too.

## KNOWN INSTRUMENT GAPS — do not build a strategy on an unverifiable number

- ⛔ **HARDWARE COUNTERS DO NOT WORK HERE** (seat2: perf unusable for IPC/branch-miss). Everything is Ir. **And a load-bearing claim depends on exactly that blind spot:** the s251 board asserts SCRIP is *instruction-count bound* at **IPC 3.20 vs 2.33**, and `ARCH-PERF-TOOLING` §7 builds a **1.4x asm ceiling** on it. Neither is currently reproducible. Row `perf-tooling-hardware-counters`. **Until it is checked, label that ceiling UNVERIFIED wherever it appears.**
- **The 1,426x compile figure** (SCRIP 12,995,512,724 Ir vs SPITBOL 9,113,074 to compile beauty) is a **recorded fact, NOT a campaign** — Lon s256 de-prioritised compile time explicitly.
- **The perf board is dead arithmetic:** ~20 rows were ranked against a profile whose #1 item (43.8% of all instructions) no longer exists, against a denominator 2.30x off. Rows `perf-board-rebaseline` · `reprofile-after-byname-bake`.

## SESSION SETUP

```bash
cd /home/claude_P && for r in SCRIP corpus .github; do git -C $r fetch -q origin && git -C $r merge --ff-only origin/main; done
bash SCRIP/scripts/s4e_msg.sh check                       # hq_P inbox
ls /home/resources/spitbol-clean/sbl                      # the BENCHMARK oracle -- absent = every number false
cd SCRIP && make pristine                                 # HQ-27
# fixed-work + callgrind, the only quotable arm:
#   echo <N> | valgrind --tool=callgrind ./prog.bin
```

## LIVE CURSOR — hq_P

**Opened s256. First action: RUNG P-0 — profile `roman` and find what 67,170 instructions per iteration are being spent on.** Report the top functions by Ir **with call counts and Ir-per-call** — Ir-per-call is the signature that exposes a linear scan, which is exactly how `bb_ab_slot_for` was caught at 22,089 Ir per procedure call. Then check whether the same function dominates beauty runtime; if it does, **one cure moves both.** ⛔ Second action: **`bash SCRIP/scripts/s4e_msg.sh fleet` on a cadence** — the old HQ never did, and two rows sat 115 and 83 minutes with zero output unnoticed.
