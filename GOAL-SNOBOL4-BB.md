# GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md — SNOBOL4 Pattern BB Templates

## ▶ CURRENT PRIORITY — READ FIRST (2026-06-02): x86() TEMPLATE-REVAMP

Convert this language's BB templates to the **`x86()` self-encoding API** (one return per `PLATFORM_*`, pure
`x86(mnem,…)` concat, no `bb_bin_t`, pBB-free). The shared looping-box **keystone is LANDED at SCRIP
`origin/main`=`30e8422` — REBASE ONTO IT BEFORE CONVERTING ANY BOX** (internal-label + ζ-frame support lives in
the SHARED `x86_asm.h`; do not rebuild it or you collide).
- **START HERE:** `GOAL-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-RULES-DRAFT.md` (rules R1–R13, divvy-up table, landed API `x86_begin()`/
  `L(n)`/`FR(off)`/`bb_slot_claim`, `x86_asm.h` vocabulary). **Reference:** `bb_pat_pos.cpp` (loop-free) +
  `bb_pat_span.cpp` (looping). **Recipe:** `HANDOFF-2026-06-02-OPUS48-SNOBOL4-BB-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-V3-KEYSTONE-POS-SPAN.md`.
- **STILL OPEN (shared):** the VARIABLE-LENGTH define/jmp-pair loop (combinators + FENCE pair path + Raku `bb_nfa`)
  — first to reach a combinator designs it once in the RULES-DRAFT.
- **YOUR BOXES:** `bb_pat_pos`✅ + `bb_pat_span`✅ + `bb_pat_abort`✅ + `bb_pat_tab`✅ + `bb_pat_atp`✅ +
  `bb_pat_arb`✅ + `bb_pat_defer`✅ + `bb_pat_fence`✅ + `bb_pat_break`✅ DONE (`x86_movimm32` / `mov32` encoder
  landed for TAB δ=r14d set; ARB uses `bb_slot_claim(8)` for its z/zo ζ-frame generator state; DEFER off
  `[r10]`→δ=r14d with the 16-byte-aligned `rt_defer_match` call preserved; FENCE single-shot save-δ-on-α/
  restore-on-β via `bb_slot_claim(4)`; BREAK+BREAKX looping, z/z_orig in `bb_slot_claim(8)` ζ-frame, internal
  labels plain L(0)/L(1) + BREAKX rescan L(2)/L(3), strchr with push/pop r10). Next loop-free leaf: NONE LEFT.
  Variable-length combinators (the STILL-OPEN define/jmp-pair design): `bb_pat_cat`, `bb_pat_alt`, `bb_match`,
  `bb_pat_fence` PAIR path (the with-children `FENCE(P)` form — the bare-FENCE primitive above is done).
- Edit only your boxes + their dispatch/decl lines; `x86_asm.h` edits are additive; `git pull --rebase` before push.
- (Full live status is in the **Watermark** near the end of this file.)

### ◀ THIS SESSION (2026-06-02, Opus 4.8) — α-OPERAND PROMOTION + `bb_lit_scalar` + `bb_sno_assign` → x86()
**`OUTPUT = "hello"` RUNS END-TO-END IN MODE-3 (prints `hello`)** — first SNOBOL4 statement restored since the
prison commit dropped m3 to 0. Three pieces landed (SCRIP):
- **NEW shared infra — α-operand promotion.** `walk_bb_node` (emit_core.c) now sets `_.op_a_sval` /
  `_.op_a_node_kind` from `nd->α` (added to `sm_emit_t` in emit_globals.h). This is the no-neighbor FACT RULE
  made practical for BINARY consumers: the dispatcher (which sees the graph) marshals the α-operand onto `_`,
  so a consumer box reads ONLY `_` — never `pBB->α`. Additive; Icon m2 12/12 unperturbed. The pattern the rest
  of the SNOBOL4 lane builds on (next: `_.op_a_slot` = promote `bb_slot_get(nd->α)` for the int-binop arm).
- **`bb_lit_scalar` → x86()** (was bb_bin_t offset-table). Pass-through arms (IR_LIT_S/NUL/F + non-flat IR_LIT_I)
  = pBB-free `jmp γ; def β; jmp ω`, byte-identical to the original IR_LIT_S arm. The **IR_LIT_I flat-chain arm
  (g_icn_flat_chain) is a documented LOUD bomb** — its 16-byte-DESCR→ζ-slot store needs a RELOCATABLE
  rip-relative load of sealed in-blob VALUES; the keystone RO encoders load ADDRESSES only. That is the **REG-RO**
  rung (anticipated in x86_asm.h, not built). Did NOT bend the RO-IP-relative FACT RULE with a movabs.
- **`bb_sno_assign` → x86()** (pBB-free). `lit_s` + `var` arms CLEAN (two RO ptr loads + one call via
  x86_load_ro/x86_call_ro): `rt_sno_assign_lit_s(dst,str)` / `rt_sno_assign_var(dst,src)`. `int-binop` +
  `concat` arms are documented LOUD bombs (int-binop needs `_.op_a_slot`; concat is the STITCH_SEQ pattern-graph
  work PB-RB-4, not a box rewrite). β = jmp ω (single-shot assign); no r10 guard / no align dance (rsp 16-aligned
  at α entry → one direct call is SysV-correct, matches the original).

**Gates GREEN:** SNOBOL4 m2 **7/7 HARD** · Icon m2 **12/12 HARD** · `test_gate_no_bb_bin_t` 0 · medium-invisible
unchanged (only Icon `bb_unop`) · concurrency invariants rc=0 · `prove_lower2` PASS · g_vstack 0. m3 still 0/6 by
the smoke harness (the `var` assign + arith/concat are gated on `bb_var` [shared lane] + `_.op_a_slot`), but
`OUTPUT="hello"` is verified correct by direct `./scrip --run`. **NEXT (SNOBOL4):** (1) `bb_var` (shared lane;
port pass-through for SNOBOL4 — check Icon's value-producing use first) → unblocks the `var` assign + `OUTPUT=S`;
(2) `_.op_a_slot` promotion + `bb_sno_assign` int-binop arm; (3) `bb_sno_subject`+`bb_match` together (MATCH reads
SUBJECT's ζ-slot), then `bb_capture`/`bb_arbno`; (4) **REG-RO** sealed-trailer encoder (unblocks `bb_lit_scalar`
IR_LIT_I + mode-4 relocatability). Detail: `HANDOFF-2026-06-02-OPUS48-SNOBOL4-BB-OP-A-PROMOTE-LIT-ASSIGN.md`.

## ⛔ `bb_bin_t` IS ABOLISHED — PATCH METADATA TRAVELS IN-BAND; NO FUNCTION COUNTS BYTES (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md)

**The `bb_bin_t { sites, labels, is_def, bytes }` struct and `bb_emit_asm_result(out, bin)` /
`bb_emit_asm_result_pairs(out)` are DELETED (Lon directive 2026-06-02). No box may name `bb_bin_t`, declare a
`bb_bin_t bin`, or call `bb_emit_asm_result`.** The struct was the carrier for a hand-counted / FUNCTION-counted
patch-offset table — the `bin.sites.push_back((int)b.size())` idiom, which is invalid: it computes a patch offset
with `b.size()` (a function of the running buffer) instead of letting the position be DISCOVERED. That idiom is the
exact nonsense the template revamp kills, and the strongest way to kill it is to remove the type so the idiom does
not COMPILE — the same enforcement-by-deletion as the no-`pBB`/`_.node` rule (a grep gate is unnecessary when the
compiler rejects it).

**THE ONE WAY: every BB template returns ONE concatenation of `x86(...)` calls and is emitted by
`bb_emit_x86(out)`.** Patch sites are TAGGED RECORDS inside that string (`L` literal bytes / `J` rel32-to-port /
`D` define-port / internal-label `L(n)` / pair-loop `E`/`F`); `bb_emit_x86` walks them and DISCOVERS each byte
position as it copies. There is NO separate offset list, so NOTHING can drift and no function ever counts bytes.
This SUPERSEDES the earlier "TWO LITERAL FORMS ONLY" framing of the BINARY arm: the hand-coded literal byte map
with a literal offset tuple was a TRANSITIONAL form; the in-band record stream is the END form, and it is what the
`b.size()` ledger was driving toward — the ledger reaches zero when the last `bb_bin_t` user is converted, not by
rewriting offset tuples by hand.

**FORBIDDEN:** `struct bb_bin_t`, `bb_bin_t bin`, `bb_emit_asm_result(...)`, `bin.sites`/`bin.labels`/`bin.is_def`,
and `(int)b.size()` (or any `.size()` of a running byte buffer used as a patch offset) anywhere in
`src/emitter/BB_templates/`, `XA_templates/`, or `emit_str.*`. The carve-out for `bb_emit_asm_result` walking a
finished string is GONE — that function no longer exists. (A box NOT YET converted is a LOUD `x86_bomb(msg)` stub
— `extern "C" void bb_foo(...) { bb_emit_x86(x86_bomb("bb_foo: …")); }` — which COMPILES + LINKS so SCRIP stays
green and ABORTS beautifully when reached; each owning session replaces its stubs with real `x86()` concatenations
as its own test reaches them.)

**ENFORCEMENT:** structural (the compiler) — `bb_bin_t` is declared nowhere, so any use fails to compile. Plus a
one-line gate `scripts/test_gate_no_bb_bin_t.sh` (comments stripped): `bb_bin_t` / `bb_emit_asm_result` live code
references == 0. **COMPLETION TEST:** (a) `emit_str.h` declares neither `bb_bin_t` nor `bb_emit_asm_result`; (b)
the gate reads zero; (c) every BB template is emitted via `bb_emit_x86`; (d) `make scrip` + `make libscrip_rt`
rc=0; (e) this FACT RULE body is byte-identical across the four GOAL-*-BB files.

## ⛔ ONE MEDIUM, INVISIBLE — NO `IF(MEDIUM_BINARY,…)` INSTRUCTION BRANCH, NO RAW-BYTE PRODUCER IN A TEMPLATE (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md)

**A template NEVER writes an instruction twice — once as GAS text, once as raw bytes — and NEVER branches on the
medium to pick between them (Lon directive 2026-06-02).** The forbidden shape (the exact nonsense this rule kills):
```
  + IF(MEDIUM_TEXT,  std::string(" mov rbx, rsp\n"))      // same instruction…
  + IF(MEDIUM_BINARY, x86_Lrec(x86_b3(0x48, 0x89, 0xE3))) // …written a second time as bytes
```
Every instruction goes through ONE `x86(mnem, …)` call; the encoder switches medium INTERNALLY, so the template
body is identical for BINARY and TEXT and a reader cannot tell which medium is active. If an instruction has no
`x86()` form yet, ADD an encoder + dispatch case to `x86_asm.h` (one place, byte-verified vs `as`) — NEVER
hand-encode it inline in the template. The missing encoder is the bug; the medium-branch is the symptom.

**FORBIDDEN inside `src/emitter/BB_templates/*.cpp`:** the raw-byte producers `x86_Lrec`, `x86_Jrec`, `x86_Drec`,
`x86_b1(`, `x86_b2(`, `x86_b3(`, `bytes(`, `u8(`, `u32le`, `u64le`; and any `IF(MEDIUM_BINARY, …)` or
`IF(MEDIUM_MACRO_DEF, …)` carrying instruction bytes. Those record/byte primitives are PRIVATE to `x86_asm.h` (the
encoders' implementation); a template only ever sees the `x86(...)` front-end + the markers (`L(n)`, `FR(off)`,
`FRQ(off)`, `PORT_*`) and the LOUD `x86_bomb(msg)` stub. **ALLOWED carve-out — TEXT-ONLY ANNOTATIONS WITH NO BYTE
FORM:** a box's leading `α:` label (`s_1asm(std::string(_.lbl_α)+":")`) and comments (`s_comment(...)`) exist only
in the GAS arm, so `IF(MEDIUM_TEXT, <comment-or-label>)` with NO matching `IF(MEDIUM_BINARY, <bytes>)` is fine; an
`IF(MEDIUM_TEXT,<gas-instruction>) + IF(MEDIUM_BINARY,<bytes>)` PAIR is the violation. Non-x86 platform arms
(JVM/JS/NET/WASM) are out of scope (X86 ONLY for now) and keep their `s_*asm` text.

**ENFORCEMENT:** gate `scripts/test_gate_template_medium_invisible.sh` (comments stripped): in `BB_templates/*.cpp`,
the raw-byte producers + `IF(MEDIUM_BINARY`/`IF(MEDIUM_MACRO_DEF` count == 0 (informational WIP baseline; `--strict`
enforces zero). **COMPLETION TEST:** (a) zero raw-byte producers and zero `IF(MEDIUM_BINARY,…)`/`IF(MEDIUM_MACRO_DEF,…)`
in any `BB_templates/*.cpp`; (b) every instruction emitted via an `x86(...)` call; (c) the gate green under `--strict`
and in the Session-Setup gate list; (d) this FACT RULE body byte-identical across the four GOAL-*-BB files.

**THREE FACES OF ONE END STATE.** This rule, the `bb_bin_t`-ABOLISHED rule above, and the no-`pBB`/`_.node` rule are
three faces of ONE converted box: pure `x86()` concatenation reading only `_`. A box that still hand-encodes bytes
ALSO still carries `bb_bin_t` and ALSO branches on the medium; converting it to `x86()` clears all three at once. The
three gates therefore reach zero TOGETHER, box-by-box, as the revamp completes — the prison is escaped only by
finishing the conversion.

## ⛔ NO C BYRD-BOX FUNCTIONS — A BOX IS ENTERED BY JUMPING TO ITS α/β LABELS, NEVER A `(ζ, int entry)` C CALL (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md, GOAL-SNOCONE-IR-BB.md)

**There is NO such thing as a C byrd-box function. The "brokered BB" concept is ABOLISHED.** A byrd box is
EMITTED machine code. It has exactly TWO entry points, and they are **LABELS** — α (fresh entry) and β
(resume). Control reaches a box by **JUMPING to one of those labels**. A box is NEVER a C function, is NEVER
reached by a C call, and NEVER takes an integer `entry` argument to select α vs β. The C signature
`DESCR_t NAME(void *ζ, int entry)` — a ζ-state pointer plus an `int entry` α/β selector — is **FORBIDDEN**.
It was the discredited brokered-BB calling convention (an "entry kludge"); it is gone. The ONLY driver is the
**mode-2 BB-graph interpreter** (`bb_exec.c`), which walks the IR graph directly and IS the broker/driver;
**modes 3 and 4 are native code in which boxes thread control by jumping between α/β labels** (RULES X86-64
register / subject-model convention) — never through a function pointer plus an `entry` integer. There is no
`bb_broker` driver and no `(ζ, int entry)` box anywhere.

**HISTORY — READ THIS, because it is why the rule now exists in this strongest form.** This prohibition has
stood for **AT LEAST TWO MONTHS**. Lon ordered these C `(ζ, int entry)` byrd boxes DELETED at least **THREE
separate times**, and each time a session either declined, re-introduced them, or held/reverted the deletion
"to keep the build green." A prior plain rule (RULES.md "NO C BYRD-BOX FUNCTIONS") did **not** hold. They
were finally deleted **2026-06-01** — the `pl_*_fn` family (all of `pl_broker.c`), `gen_bb_dcg`,
`gen_bb_oneshot`, `resolve_bb_dcg`, `bb_deferred_var`/`_exported`, `fail_box`, the dead `bb_cap`/`bb_atp`
declarations, **and the `bb_broker` driver itself** (`bb_broker.c`). **KEEPING THE BUILD GREEN IS NOT A
LICENSE TO PRESERVE A FORBIDDEN BOX.** When this signature and a green build conflict, the **signature
loses**: delete the box and tear out its callers (the brokered execution path — Prolog `--run`, brokered
pattern scan, brokered generators — is removed, not preserved). A broken build pending the caller teardown is
acceptable; a surviving `(ζ, int entry)` box is not.

**COMPLETION TEST:** (a) `grep -rnE 'DESCR_t[[:space:]]+[A-Za-z_]+[[:space:]]*\([[:space:]]*void[[:space:]]*\*[[:space:]]*[a-z]*[[:space:]]*,[[:space:]]*int[[:space:]]+entry' src/ --include=*.c --include=*.cpp --include=*.h | grep -v typedef` == 0 (no C byrd-box definition or declaration with the `(ζ, int entry)` signature); (b) no `bb_broker` driver function exists; (c) every emitted box is entered by a jump to an α or β label, never a C call with an `entry` int; (d) this FACT RULE body is byte-identical across the five GOAL-*-BB files.

## ⛔ NO VALUE STACK — EVER (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md, GOAL-SNOCONE-IR-BB.md)

**SCRIP HAS NO VALUE STACK. NO SESSION, IN ANY LANGUAGE, MAY CREATE ONE.** (Lon directive, 2026-05-31.)
There is nothing like a value stack in SCRIP — every value a BB graph computes or holds at run time lives
INSIDE a box: a READ-ONLY operand constant reached `[rip+disp]` into sealed data, or a READ-WRITE slot
reached `[ζ=r12+off]` in the per-sequence one-register frame (the `test_sno_1.c`/`test_icon.c` named-slot
model). A consumer reads a producer's result directly from that producer's slot. A value is NEVER pushed
to or popped from a global stack, and intermediate producer→consumer values are NEVER threaded through a
name-table round-trip. This is the same law as the PER-BOX LOCAL STORAGE FACT RULE; this rule states the
prohibition in the strongest, language-independent form so it cannot be re-introduced from any session.

**The `g_vstack` global array is DELETED (2026-05-31) and must NEVER be resurrected** — nor any equivalent
under a different name (`*_vstack[]`, `value_stack`, `g_estack`, a hand-rolled `WamWord[]`/`DESCR_t[]`
push/pop arena used to pass values between boxes, etc.). FORBIDDEN to (re)introduce: a global/static array
whose purpose is to push a box's value and pop it in a consumer; `rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*`/`vstack_*` value
traffic; any `*_push`/`*_pop` helper that moves an *intermediate* value between boxes. (KEEP, NOT a value
stack: the Prolog trail `g_resolve_trail`/`rt_pl_trail_*` — a binding-undo ledger; the choice-point ledger
`g_resolve_bfr`/`resolve_choice` — the irreducible cross-node resume spine; the C call stack used for
genuine recursion; an ARBNO-style explicit indexed per-activation frame array. None of these is a value
stack.) The residual `vstack_*`/`rt_vstack_ops_t` SCAFFOLDING left in `src/runtime/rt/rt.c` is dead/aborting
(`g_ops` only ever points at `g_default_ops`, whose push/pop/peek `abort()`); it is being removed rung by
rung (the VSX ladder) and must NOT be wired up to anything — adding a real backing store to it = creating a
value stack = a violation.

**GUARD:** `scripts/test_gate_no_vstack.sh` (informational baseline now; flips to a HARD `--strict`
zero-check at VSX-8). It greps (comments stripped) ACROSS ALL `src/` for `g_vstack`/`vstack_push`/
`vstack_pop`/`vstack_peek`/`rt_vstack_*`. The `g_vstack` token is already at ZERO and must STAY at zero;
the rest trend to zero as the scaffolding is deleted. Any session that makes the `g_vstack` count non-zero,
or that adds a new value-stack array under any name, has violated this rule. **COMPLETION TEST:** (a)
`grep -rn 'g_vstack' src/` == 0 (code AND comments); (b) no new global/static push/pop value arena exists;
(c) `scripts/test_gate_no_vstack.sh` `g_vstack` line reads 0; (d) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical
across all five GOAL-*-BB files.

## ⛔ TWO LITERAL FORMS ONLY — MEDIUM_BINARY IS A HAND-CODED LITERAL BYTE MAP; NO FUNCTION MAY COUNT BYTES (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md, GOAL-SNOCONE-IR-BB.md)

**Every BB template emits its x86 in exactly TWO LITERAL forms, both counted BY HAND.** (1) `MEDIUM_BINARY`
is a hand-coded LITERAL byte map — `bytes("\x..")` opcode literals plus a LITERAL patch-offset map
(`bin = {{13,65,80,84,95}, {…}, {…}}` with HARDCODED constant offsets). (2) `MEDIUM_TEXT` is literal GAS asm.
Both forms are LITERALS. This is DELIBERATE, not a stopgap: a single shared/computed template proved
unmaintainable — it kept getting split apart — so each box is its own small template carrying its own
hand-coded byte map, and that literal form is the one that stays correct. (Lon directive, 2026-06-01 —
re-issued after a session INVERTED it: literal bytes + literal asm are RIGHT; the function-counter is WRONG.)

**FORBIDDEN — the ONLY thing that makes a site BAD: using a FUNCTION to count or compute the bytes.**
Specifically `b.size()` in any form (`bin.sites.push_back((int)b.size())`, `int off = (int)b.size()`,
`int mr_off = (int)b.size()`), or any helper that DERIVES a patch offset from the running buffer length
instead of a hardcoded literal constant. Every offset in `bin` must be a LITERAL integer, never a function
of the buffer. (CARVE-OUT: `bb_emit_asm_result` in `emit_str.cpp` may walk the FINISHED byte string with
`.size()` when it emits/patches — that is the consumer reading a complete literal, NOT a template counting
its own bytes; the prohibition is on a TEMPLATE deriving its patch offsets from a function.)

**NOT bad — explicitly allowed, do NOT flag or "fix" these:** hand-written `bytes("\x..")` opcode literals;
hardcoded `bin = {{…},{…},{…}}` literal offset tuples; literal internal rel32 deltas (`+65`, `-98`) written
as constants; `u8()/u32le()/u64le()` building literal immediates; `TEMPLATE_ADDR_*` address bakes. These ARE
the hand-coded byte map — the CORRECT, supported form. A box that hand-encodes bytes with literal offsets is GREEN.

**GUARD:** `scripts/test_gate_no_handencoded_bytes.sh` (informational baseline now; flips to a HARD `--strict`
zero-check). It counts, per `BB_templates/*.cpp` (comments stripped), every `b.size()` — the function
byte-counter — which is the ONLY bad pattern. The count only ever decreases as `b.size()` sites are rewritten
to literal offset maps; any session that raises it has violated this rule. **COMPLETION TEST:** (a)
`scripts/test_gate_no_handencoded_bytes.sh --strict` green — zero `b.size()` in any `BB_templates/*.cpp`;
(b) every `MEDIUM_BINARY` arm uses a hand-coded LITERAL byte map with hardcoded offsets, never a function to
count bytes; (c) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical across all five GOAL-*-BB files.

>   - **Fork B — "build" = SPLICE (wire ports), NOT JIT-emit.** A pattern-valued variable already holds a

>     boundary is exactly the call/return seam where an explicit continuation hand-off is wanted anyway, so it is
>     not an exception to paper over.
>   - **`BB_LINK` IS PURE TAIL, NOT A PORTED BOX.** α loads-and-jumps; no β; no γ/ω. Keep it strictly "indirect
>     jump through a frame slot, no state, no return" so it can never become a re-dispatch point. The all-invariant

## ⛔ SHARED-LOWERER ONE-FILE CONCURRENCY (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md)

The unified AST→IR lowerer is **ONE file** — `src/lower/lower.c` (formerly `lower2.c`, the new tree root after old `lower.c` was deleted 2026-05-31) — with **ONE entry** (`lower2`, role-seeded via `lower2_{value,pattern,goal}_entry`) and **ONE big switch over the shared `tree_e`** (every `TT_*`). SNOBOL4, Icon, and Prolog are developed CONCURRENTLY in SEPARATE sessions, all writing into this one file. Each language adds ARMS the others don't; the discipline below makes three concurrent sessions **conflict-free and mutually beneficial** (one session's added case label / shared helper is the next session's ready slot):

1. **ONE CASE PER KIND.** Each `TT_*` is at most ONE `case` label per role switch. If your language needs a kind with no case yet → ADD the case. If the case exists → ADD YOUR ARM to it. **NEVER duplicate the label.** (Win-win: SNOBOL4 adding `case TT_ASSIGN` hands Icon/Prolog a ready slot.)

2. **LANGUAGE VARIATION LIVES INSIDE THE CASE — NEVER A PER-LANGUAGE FORK.** When a kind behaves differently per language, branch on `cx.lang` (or role) WITHIN the one case (`switch (cx.lang) { case IR_LANG_SNO: …; case IR_LANG_PL: …; }`, or if/else). No per-language lowering functions, no per-language files. One kind → one case → language arms inside.

3. **EDIT ONLY YOUR OWN LANGUAGE'S ARM.** A session may ADD or MODIFY the `cx.lang` arm for its OWN language inside any case. It must **NEVER modify, reorder, or delete another language's arm.** This is what makes the three sessions' diffs non-overlapping → git auto-merges with **zero conflicts**.

4. **A MISSING LANGUAGE ARM FALLS LOUD, NEVER SILENT.** Inside a case, a language with no arm yet routes to `lower_unhandled` (loud stderr + NULL) — never a silent or wrong default. A half-built arm fails LOUDLY so it can never corrupt a peer's proven path.

5. **SHARED SCAFFOLDING IS ADDITIVE; SIGNATURE/SEMANTIC CHANGES ARE LOCKSTEP.** The cursor (`lcx_t`), the port primitives (`nalloc`/`set_succ_fail`/`ret`/`emit_leaf`), and the match-collect library (`tm`/`tm_g`) are SHARED. ADDING a helper or a case label is free (no conflict). CHANGING the signature/semantics of an existing shared helper or of `lcx_t` affects all three cats → it MUST update all three GOAL files' FACT RULE in the SAME commit and re-prove all three.

6. **THE TOPOLOGY PROOF GATE IS THE SHARED GREEN SIGNAL.** `scripts/prove_lower2.sh` must stay green before every commit. Each cat's proof cases are ADDITIVE (append your own; never delete a peer's). Green = your arm wired right AND you didn't disturb a peer.

**COMPLETION TEST:** (a) no duplicated `case TT_` label within any one switch in `lower.c`; (b) every case's language branches end in a real arm or `lower_unhandled` (no silent default); (c) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical across the three GOAL files (`awk '/SHARED-LOWERER ONE-FILE/{p=1} p{print} /prove_lower2.sh green/{if(p)exit}'` md5 matches — first-match, not greedy `sed`); (d) `scripts/prove_lower2.sh` green.

## ⛔ TEMPLATE-ONLY EMISSION — ONE-DISPATCH CONCURRENCY (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md)

The unified IR→x86 emitter is **ONE dispatch** — `src/emitter/emit_core.c`'s `switch (nd->t)` over the shared `IR_e` — fanning out to **per-box template functions** under `src/emitter/{BB,SM,XA}_templates/`. Every byte of emitted machine code lives INSIDE a template fn reached ONLY via this dispatch (RULES.md TEMPLATE-ONLY). SNOBOL4, Icon, and Prolog fill emitter boxes CONCURRENTLY in SEPARATE sessions, all writing into this one dispatch + this one template tree. The discipline below makes the three sessions **conflict-free and mutually beneficial** (one session's dispatch case + template file is the next session's ready slot), exactly mirroring the SHARED-LOWERER rule:

1. **ONE DISPATCH CASE PER IR KIND.** Each `IR_*` is at most ONE `case` label in `emit_core.c`. If your language's kind has no case → ADD it (one line: `case IR_FOO: bb_foo(nd); return 0;`). If it exists → it already calls the right template; do not duplicate. **NEVER duplicate the label.** Append new cases at the END of the language's contiguous block (SNOBOL `IR_PAT_*` block, Prolog `IR_GOAL/ARITH/BUILTIN/LOGICVAR/ATOM/STRUCT/UNIFY/CUT/DISJ/GCONJ` block, Icon `IR_EVERY/ALT/LIMIT/SCAN/TO/…` block) so the three sessions' inserts land in different hunks → git auto-merges.

2. **ONE TEMPLATE FILE PER BOX — NEVER A SHARED MEGA-FILE.** Each box's bytes live in its OWN `.cpp` (e.g. `bb_pat_len.cpp`, `bb_unify.cpp`, `bb_every.cpp`). A session creating a new box CREATES a new file; it never appends a second box's body into a peer's file. Per-box files = per-session non-overlapping edits. Duplicating a byte pattern INTO each template is REQUIRED (duplication is the point — RULES.md); never factor shared bytes into a common emitter helper that two languages edit.

3. **EDIT ONLY YOUR OWN LANGUAGE'S BOXES.** A session may ADD or MODIFY template files for ITS OWN language's kinds and the ONE dispatch line that reaches each. It must **NEVER modify another language's template body or dispatch line.** (SNOBOL touches `bb_pat_*`; Prolog touches `bb_goal/arith/unify/cut/disj/conj/atom/struct/logicvar`; Icon touches `bb_every/alt/limit/scan/to/iterate/…`.)

4. **BYTES LIVE ONLY IN TEMPLATES — A MISSING BOX FALLS LOUD.** FORBIDDEN outside a template fn: `seg_byte(SEG_CODE`, `SL_B(`, `sl_emit_one`, `emit_standard_blob`, and the raw byte-producers `bytes()/u8()/u32le()/u64le()` (allowed only in `bomb_bytes`/`bb_emit_asm_result` of `emit_str.cpp`). A kind with no template yet must hit the dispatch's loud default (assert/abort), never silently emit nothing or fall through. `scripts/util_template_purity_audit.sh` is the standing guard.

5. **THE SHARED SOURCE LIST IS ADDITIVE; BUILD/ABI CHANGES ARE LOCKSTEP.** The Makefile `RT_PIC_SRCS` template list is APPEND-ONLY — add your new `.cpp` on its own line at the end of the language's group (one line = one hunk, no conflict). ADDING a template + its source line + its dispatch case is free. CHANGING a shared emitter primitive (`emit_core` dispatch signature, `BB_t`/`IR_t` layout, the `operand_aux` sidecar API, register-frame ABI) affects all three → it MUST update all three GOAL files' FACT RULE in the SAME commit and re-prove all three.

6. **THE EMITTER GATES ARE THE SHARED GREEN SIGNAL.** Before every commit: `scripts/util_template_purity_audit.sh` (no bytes outside templates), `scripts/test_gate_em_template_byte_identity.sh` + `scripts/test_gate_em_template_matrix.sh` (templates emit the sanctioned bytes), and the per-language no-stack/one-reg gates (`test_gate_icn_no_stack.sh`, `test_gate_icn_one_reg_frame.sh`) must stay green. Green = your box emits right AND you didn't disturb a peer.

**COMPLETION TEST:** (a) no duplicated `case IR_` label in `emit_core.c` (`grep -oE 'case IR_[A-Z_]+' src/emitter/emit_core.c | sort | uniq -d` empty); (b) every `IR_*` kind a language emits has exactly one dispatch case reaching one template fn, unmatched kinds hit the loud default; (c) zero forbidden byte-emitters outside templates (`util_template_purity_audit.sh` clean); (d) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical across the three GOAL files (`awk '/TEMPLATE-ONLY EMISSION — ONE-DISPATCH/{p=1} p{print} /util_template_purity_audit.sh clean/{if(p)exit}'` md5 matches); (e) the emitter gates above are green.

## ⛔ NO DUPLICATED LOGIC — WRITE EACH PIECE OF LOGIC ONCE (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md)

**This is a LOGIC problem, not a formatting problem.** (Lon, 2026-06-01.) The template tree is BAD CODE: the same logic is written over and over. `bb_builtin.cpp`
is 2,427 lines because of duplication, not because the work is big. Fix the duplication; the line count
collapses on its own.

**THE ONE LAW: each piece of logic is written ONCE.** A box does PORT work (α/β/γ/ω wiring). The runtime does
VALUE work (build a term, compare, arithmetic, concat). When a box reimplements VALUE work inline, you get
duplication — and duplication is the disease in every form below.

**DUP FORM 1 — THE SAME ALGORITHM IN TWO MEDIA (worst, the bulk of the bloat).** `emit_build_compound_term`
(92 lines, emits GAS text) and `emit_build_compound_term_bin` (94 lines, emits raw bytes) are the SAME
post-order Term-builder written TWICE. A bug must be fixed in both or they drift. THE FIX IS NOT TO MERGE THE
TWO WALKERS — it is to DELETE BOTH. Building a Term is a RUNTIME job; `rt_pl_compound_build_n` and
`rt_pl_node_to_term` already do it. The box marshals operand slots into registers and `call`s the helper.
Once it is one `rt_*` call there is NOTHING to duplicate: TEXT emits `call foo@PLT`, BINARY emits
`movabs rax,&foo; call rax` — two trivial encodings of ONE logical call, which is the sanctioned per-medium
difference (NOT duplicated logic). ~18 builtin families currently each call BOTH walkers; killing the walkers
sheds >1,000 lines.

**DUP FORM 2 — EMIT-TIME LOGIC THAT IS A RUNTIME JOB.** Root cause of FORM 1. Any time a template grows a
recursive walker, an arithmetic evaluator, a comparator, a term constructor — that is VALUE work in the wrong
place. It belongs behind ONE `rt_*` call. (Guard, GOAL-BB-TEMPLATE-LADDER invariant 9: never add an
`rt_*_exec` that does α/β/γ/ω PORT logic — that is a C byrd box. The split is clean: RT = value, BOX = ports.
If you are emitting more than "marshal args, call helper, wire the 4 ports," you are duplicating runtime logic
into the emitter.)

**DUP FORM 3 — AN OPERAND BOX REIMPLEMENTED INSIDE ITS CONSUMER (fusion).** `bb_binop` reads
`pBB->α->t == IR_LIT_I` and seals the operand's VALUE (`pBB->α->ival`) in its own blob — reimplementing what
`bb_lit_scalar` already does (put a literal where a consumer can read it). Two pieces of code, one job. The
consumer must READ the operand's slot (`bb_slot_get(pBB->α)`); the operand's own box fills it. DELETE the
operand-kind arm. (PREREQ, proven 2026-06-01: deleting GZ-3/GZ-4 today breaks `write(2+3)` because the lowerer
does not yet chain literal operands as producer boxes in that shape — so the de-fuse step is first a LOWERER
fix that makes both operands producers, THEN the deletion.) Any `pBB->α->ival/sval/dval` or `->α->t==IR_LIT_*`
read inside a consumer box = fusion = duplicated operand logic.

**DUP FORM 4 — N DIFFERENT BOXES IN ONE FILE (cram).** `bb_binop.cpp` held 7 unrelated four-port shapes
selected by `op`/operand-kind/`g_*_flat_chain`. Each distinct shape is its own box; a `_str()` returning
several different complete four-port byte sequences is N boxes in one filename. This is the LEAST harmful dup
(it is co-location, not copied algorithm) but it hides the others. De-cram by splitting distinct shapes behind
a thin router (`bb_foo.cpp` keeps the `extern "C" void bb_foo(IR_t*)` so `emit_core.c` is untouched; each shape
is `bb_foo_<shape>_str(...)` returning its bytes or `""`; router calls each in order). Worked example DONE:
`bb_binop_*.cpp` + 38-line `bb_binop.cpp`.

**NOT DUPLICATION — DO NOT "FIX" THESE.** (a) The same byte pattern hand-copied INTO each per-box template is
REQUIRED (RULES.md — duplication of bytes across boxes is the point; never factor into a shared emitter helper
two languages edit). (b) Per-file op-classifier tables (`gen_is_numrel`, `gen_rel_to_tt`) copied per file —
acceptable, per-file, no shared edit. (c) Boxes 95%+ identical SHARE one file parameterized by an immediate /
opcode / register (`bb_lit_scalar` groups IR_LIT_I/S/F/NUL; `bb_binop_arith` groups ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV/MOD) —
grouping near-identical SHAPES is correct; splitting them is over-splitting. (d) The two ARMS of one box
(`IF(BINARY)`/`IF(TEXT)`) are two encodings of one logic — NOT duplication. The line is always: copied
*algorithm* = bad; copied *bytes/encoding* of one logic = fine.

**THE TEST:** could a bug in this code require fixing the same logic in two places? If yes → duplication →
collapse it (delete the emit-time copy in favor of one `rt_*` call; delete the fused operand arm in favor of
the slot read; delete the second-medium walker).

**COMPLETION TEST (per file):** (a) no algorithm (walker / evaluator / comparator / term-builder) appears in
both a TEXT arm and a BINARY arm — value work is ONE `rt_*` call; (b) no emit-time reimplementation of runtime
value work; (c) no operand-kind read (`pBB->α->ival/sval/dval`, `->α->t==IR_LIT_*`) inside a consumer box;
(d) one four-port shape per `_str()` (or a pure router); (e) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical across all
four GOAL files.

## ⛔ X86-64 REGISTER / SUBJECT-MODEL CONVENTION (FACT — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md)

Locked callee-saved layout the three concurrent BB sessions MUST share (canonical origin: GOAL-ICON-BB "Subject model — four names, zero redundancy"; casing inherited from the snobol4jvm Clojure SNOBOL4). **Casing carries meaning: UPPERCASE = the fixed whole/bound; lowercase = the moving position.**

| Reg | Class | Name | Role |
|-----|-------|------|------|
| **R13** | callee-saved | **Σ** (UPPER) | subject BASE ptr — the fixed whole string |
| **R14** | callee-saved | **δ** (lower) | CURSOR — the moving scan position |
| **R15** | callee-saved | **Δ** (UPPER) | subject LENGTH/END — the fixed bound |
| (scratch) | — | **σ** (lower) | TRANSIENT current-char ptr `Σ+δ`, computed at deref, NOT durable |
| **R12** | callee-saved | **ζ** (zeta) | BB-local RW FRAME base; every box-local is `[r12+off]` (RATIFIED 2026-05-30) |
| **R10** | caller-saved | LOCAL | per-BLOB DATA-block ptr (`lea r10,[rip+Δ_data]`); constant inside a BLOB |
| **rbx** | callee-saved | — | FREE / callee-saved scratch (preserved across the box chain) |
| **rbp** | callee-saved | — | DEFINE'd / brokered function frame ptr when active (`push rbp;mov rbp,rsp`); else callee-saved scratch |

**γ-success return packing:** `rax = σ ptr`, `rdx = δ int` (spec_t).

**RETIREMENT (all three sessions must honor):** the old **`Ω`** (omega — mode-2 `refs/bb/test_*.c` oracle) and **`Σlen`** (mode-3/4 `bb_pat_*.cpp` templates) are ONE quantity under two names → **both fold into `Δ`**; always moved in lockstep. Rename sweep: `Δ(old cursor)→δ`, `Ω→Δ`, `Σlen→Δ`. Substring nesting is held on the C stack (`save_Σ`/`save_Σlen`), so ONE length register suffices. **Pre-flight gate before deleting a name:** grep that no path ever sets `Σlen ≠ Ω`. Changing any assignment in this table is LOCKSTEP — update all three GOAL files in the SAME commit (mirrors the SHARED-LOWERER / EMITTER FACT RULES).

## ⛔ PER-BOX LOCAL STORAGE — ALL STATE LIVES INSIDE THE BOXES (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md)

**ONLY local BB allocation variables are used; NOTHING is stored outside the boxes.** Every value a
SNOBOL4 (or Icon / Prolog) BB graph computes or holds at run time lives in storage that belongs to a
box — never in any external/global side channel. There is NO AG ring at run time (the ring is the
MODE-2 ORACLE's idiom ONLY — `bb_exec_once`), NO value stack (`g_vstack`/`rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*`), and
intermediate values are NOT threaded through the global name table (`NV_GET`/`NV_SET`) — name-table
stores are reserved for genuine SNOBOL4 *variables* on assignment, not for passing a value from a
producer box to its consumer.

**Each box owns exactly two kinds of local allocation, both INSIDE the box (not outside):**
- **READ-ONLY data (RO)** — compile-time constants for that box (literal int/real/string/cset values,
  the box's name string, fixed bounds, op codes). Placed in the SEALED segment adjacent to the box's
  BLOB and reached by IP-relative addressing (`lea/mov reg,[rip+disp]`, `disp` an emit-time constant in
  the BINARY arm; a `.L`-label in the TEXT arm). RO data is NEVER threaded on a stack and NEVER reached
  by an absolute `movabs … &slot` immediate.
- **READ-WRITE data (RW)** — the box's mutable runtime storage (its result value/DESCR slot, counters,
  cursors, per-box backtrack arenas, generator state). Lives in the per-sequence ONE-REGISTER FRAME and
  is reached register-relative `[ζ=r12 + emit_time_offset]`. A consumer reads a producer box's result by
  that producer's frame offset (`bb_slot_get`/`bb_slot_alloc`); a SNOBOL4/Icon *variable* is ONE
  name-keyed frame slot (`bb_varslot`) shared by its IR_ASSIGN(name) writer and IR_VAR(name) readers.

So every box value reference is exactly one of: **(RO)** `[rip+disp]` into sealed data, or **(RW)**
`[ζ+off]` into the per-sequence frame. Never a ring, never a value stack, never a name-table round-trip
for an intermediate. This is the `test_sno_1.c` / `test_icon.c` named-slot law the GZ-7 Icon and PLG-8
Prolog siblings already follow (`febef10`: `x:=42;write(x)` → m2==m3==m4, all slot-based, no ring).

**COMPLETION TEST (per box family):** (a) no `bb_exec_once`/AG-ring read or write on the mode-3/4 run
path; (b) no `g_vstack`/`rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*`; (c) no `NV_GET`/`NV_SET` used to carry an *intermediate*
producer→consumer value (only true variable assignment); (d) every box-local read is `[rip+disp]` (RO)
or `[ζ+off]` (RW) — no `movabs … &pBB->slot` absolute slot address; (e) mode-3 BINARY arm and mode-4
TEXT arm of the SAME box do the SAME processing (the only diff is BINARY-bytes vs GAS-text).

## 🔴🔴 #0 PRIORITY — BB-HYGIENE LADDER (SNOBOL4) — ORDERED, DO BEFORE REG LADDER (Lon 2026-06-01)

Per the BB-HYGIENE FACT RULE. **STRICT ORDER — lowest number first.** De-cram + de-fuse each file (de-cram first because cram hides the duplicated logic underneath it), then the de-dup/RT-fix sweep. After EACH step: SNOBOL4 m2 7/7 HARD byte-identical, smoke 3-mode unchanged, purity green, commit. Copy the worked example: `bb_binop_*.cpp` + 38-line `bb_binop.cpp` router (Icon-owned; done 2026-06-01). The de-cram steps are prep; **SNO-HY-7 (de-dup + RT-fix) is the core fix** — collapse any logic written twice.

- [ ] **SNO-HY-1 — `bb_pat_break.cpp` (349).** De-cram: one file per distinct four-port shape behind a `bb_pat_break` router. Group 95%-identical cursor-advance shapes (do NOT over-split). De-fuse any `pBB->…->ival/sval` operand reads.
- [ ] **SNO-HY-2 — `bb_pat_tab.cpp` (286) + `bb_pat_span.cpp` (271).** TAB/RTAB and SPAN: split inline-vs-RT-call shapes; group near-identical. Routers.
- [ ] **SNO-HY-3 — `bb_sno_assign.cpp` (226) + `bb_capture.cpp` (226).** Split literal-rhs vs slot-rhs vs name-store; the capture deque-save vs @-cursor-write. **De-fuse: a literal rhs is its own producer box — read its slot, do not seal its value here.**
- [ ] **SNO-HY-4 — `bb_pat_any.cpp` (218) + `bb_pat_notany.cpp` (215).** cset-blob vs single-char; group if 95%-identical between the two files' shapes. Routers.
- [ ] **SNO-HY-5 — `bb_pat_cat.cpp` (194) + `bb_pat_alt.cpp` (185) + `bb_pat_arb.cpp` (183).** Combinators. The variable-length define/jmp-pair loop is its own shape; fixed shape another. (The variable-length define/jmp-pair loop derives offsets from a running length — that is a separate design question; split the shapes now.) Routers.
- [ ] **SNO-HY-6 — audit the rest (`bb_pat_len` 161, `bb_pat_pos` 158).** Split only if >1 four-port shape; else mark NO-SPLIT-NEEDED. `bb_lit.cpp` (185) — its 5 platform arms (`if (PLATFORM_X86/JVM/JS/NET/WASM)`) are the sanctioned per-platform multiplex, NOT a violation; leave it.
- [ ] **SNO-HY-7 — de-dup + RT-fix, all SNOBOL4 boxes.** Any algorithm in both a TEXT and BINARY arm → DELETE both, replace with one `rt_*` call. No emit-time value work (term-build/compare/arith go to RT).
- [ ] **SNO-HY-FENCE — gate.** `scripts/test_gate_bb_one_box.sh` green for SNOBOL4-owned files; wired into Session Setup. m2 7/7 HARD held throughout.

## 🔴 CURRENT PRIORITY (Lon directive 2026-06-01) — DO THIS FIRST: REG LADDER (BB TEMPLATES → RATIFIED REGISTERS)

**The SNOBOL4 pattern BB templates are NOT yet on the ratified registers** — they still use the legacy subject
model (`[r10]` cursor; Σ/Δ via `movabs &Σ`/`&Σlen` = emitter-process global addresses). Migrating them to
Σ=R13 / δ=R14 / Δ=R15 / ζ=R12 is **the current top priority** (Lon): it brings convention compliance AND removes
the process-local-address bake that blocks SNOBOL **mode-4** (the m4 0/6 cause). This ladder runs BEFORE the rest
of the PB-RB feature ladder (PB-RB-4+) and the BROKERED-ERADICATION rung (both still below, lower priority until
the registers are correct). REG-0 is coupled to PB-RB-3 (now landed), so REG-1 (`bb_lit`) is the first code step.

### ⭐⭐ REG LADDER — SNOBOL4 PATTERN-FAMILY REGISTER-LAYOUT MIGRATION (Lon directive 2026-06-01, Opus 4.8)

Bring the SNOBOL4 pattern family from the **legacy subject model** (cursor in the `[r10]` per-BLOB data-block
field; Σ via `movabs &Σ;deref`/`lea [rip+Σ]`; Δ via `movabs &Σlen`/`[rip+Σlen]` — `TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIGMA`/
`TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIGLEN` = **emitter-process global addresses**) to the **ratified register convention** Σ=R13,
δ=R14, Δ=R15 (ζ=R12, r10 stays the per-BLOB DATA-block ptr). Two wins in one: (a) convention compliance; (b)
**removes the process-local-address bake → SNOBOL mode-4 relocatability** (the m4 0/6 blocker). NOT a convention
change (the table is untouched) → SNOBOL-session-local, no lockstep. Each step: prove topology
(`prove_lower2.sh`) unchanged, migrate BINARY+TEXT arms together (SAME processing, only bytes-vs-GAS differ),
disasm-verify the new register usage, gate. **Mode-2 oracle (`bb_exec.c`) is UNTOUCHED — these are modes-3/4
templates only; m2 7/7 HARD must stay invariant every step.**

- [ ] **REG-0 — register-establishment contract + r13 de-confliction (PREREQ; coupled to PB-RB-3).** Pin who sets
  R13/R14/R15 and that they survive the chain. Canonical: **BB_MATCH (PB-RB-3) α** loads `R13 ← Σ-slot`,
  `R15 ← Δ-slot` from SUBJECT's ζ-frame and `xor r14,r14` (δ=0, ch.18 step 1) before entering the element graph;
  the ch.18 OUTER start-loop re-sets R14 per start-iteration. R13/R14/R15 are **callee-saved (SysV)** so they
  survive `call memcmp@PLT` with NO per-box save (only the caller-saved r10 needs `push r10`/`pop r10`).
  **r13 de-confliction:** r13 doubles as the SM-state register ONLY in SM context; SNOBOL pattern chains emit
  ZERO SM opcodes (sibling of ICON SM = ZERO OPCODES), so R13=Σ is unambiguous on this path. NO element edits in
  REG-0 — it is the contract REG-1+ depend on. **DO REG-0 AS PART OF PB-RB-3's BB_MATCH α** (preferred), or — to
  unit-test elements before BB_MATCH — a thin subject-register prologue shim in `sno_flat_chain_build`/`_text`
  that loads R13/R15 from SUBJECT's ζ-slots + zeroes R14 after the SUBJECT box. Gate: build rc=0; all gates
  invariant (no element bytes changed yet).
- [ ] **REG-1 — migrate `bb_lit` (the proven reference element).** BINARY+TEXT: cursor read `mov eax,[r10]` →
  `mov eax, r14d`; cursor write `mov [r10], eax` → `mov r14d, eax`; Σ-base `movabs rax,&Σ; mov rax,[rax]` (BIN) /
  `lea rcx,[rip+Σ]; mov rax,[rcx]` (TEXT) → use `r13` directly; Δ-compare `movabs rcx,&Σlen; cmp eax,[rcx]` →
  `cmp eax, r15d`. β arm: `δ -= len` becomes `sub r14d, len` (no `[r10]`). Re-derive the byte sequence + patch
  offsets (the patch tuple shrinks — the two `movabs`+deref blocks vanish). Removes both `TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIG*`
  bakes from `bb_lit`. Prove: prove_lower2 topology unchanged; mode-3 `S 'b'` in `'abc'` → `[1,2]` under REG-0;
  disasm shows cursor=r14/Σ=r13/Δ=r15, no `&Σ`/`&Σlen` imm64. Gate: m2 7/7 HARD invariant; m3 ≥ floor; purity
  clean; g_vstack==0.
- [x] **REG-2 — cursor-advancing leaves. 6/6 COMPLETE (SCRIP `65686c2`, 2026-06-01 Opus 4.8).** `bb_pat_len`,
  `bb_pat_any`, `bb_pat_notany`, `bb_pat_span`, `bb_pat_break`, `bb_pat_rem` — same rewrite per box (verify each box's
  actual cursor-field offset + `&Σ`/`&Σlen` sites against disasm before editing; they are NOT all identical). Each step
  removes that box's `TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIG*` bakes. Gate per box (or small sub-group); m2 invariant.
  **First 5 (SCRIP `eb4bf7c`):** `bb_pat_len` (34B, sites {13,25,29,30}), `bb_pat_rem` (13B, {4,8,9}), `bb_pat_any`
  (74B, {8,52,61,65,70}), `bb_pat_notany` (74B, same; byte@50 `0F84`→`0F85`), `bb_pat_span` (195B,
  {118,143,147,167,191}; internal Δ jge +62 / je +18 / jmp loop −86; r11 base-copy + its push/pop dropped, Σ=r13 used
  directly). **`bb_pat_break` LANDED THIS SESSION (dual-arm, both converted in one pass for the REG-FENCE grep):**
  plain BREAK **153B, sites {125,129,149}** (internal Δ jge +63 / jnz +19 / jmp loop −88); BREAKX **290B, sites
  {125,130,134,265,286}** (α scan + β rescan; identical per-loop internal jumps jge +87 / jnz +19 / jmp loop −88;
  `z` in [zeta+8], `z_orig` in [zeta+12] — the 4B padding of the 16B `rt_cs_t`, recovered as δ−z before z++). Both
  arms assembled+objdump-verified via the `as`-transcribe route, then Python byte-recounted to confirm every site.
  BINARY+TEXT both; r11 + push/pop r11 dropped (Σ=r13 direct), only push/pop r10 around strchr remains. Token-clean:
  zero `TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIG*`/`[r10]` in code OR comment. β semantics preserved (BREAK δ−=z on β; BREAKX z_orig recover
  + z++ + rescan-to-next). Zero `b.size()` introduced (stash-verified: 123 with and without the diff).
- [ ] **REG-3 — cursor-verify / position leaves.** `bb_pat_pos` (RPOS folded), `bb_pat_tab` (RTAB folded),
  `bb_pat_atp` (`@var` writes the cursor → write R14). POS/RPOS read R14 (and Δ=R15 for RPOS) and compare; TAB/RTAB
  advance R14 to a computed target. Gate; m2 invariant.
- [ ] **REG-4 — combinators.** `bb_pat_alt`, `bb_pat_cat`, `bb_pat_fence` — they thread δ via the ports and
  save/restore δ on backtrack: the saved-δ slot moves from the `[r10]` data-block field to a **ζ-slot save of R14**
  (`mov [r12+off], r14d` / restore), NOT `[r10]`. FENCE seals δ on α, restores on β (commit) — now via R14+ζ-slot.
  Gate; m2 invariant.
- [ ] **REG-5 — generators + capture (coordinate with BROK-1/BROK-2).** `bb_pat_arb`, `bb_arbno`, `bb_capture`
  (the `std::deque<int>` saved-δ pattern stores R14 snapshots), `bb_pat_defer`. Per-activation δ state migrates
  from the `[r10]` block to R14 + ζ-slot/deque saves. Since BROK-1/BROK-2 convert CAPTURE/ARBNO to jump-to-α/β,
  do REG-5 **with or after** those rungs to avoid double-rework. Gate; m2 invariant.
- [ ] **REG-RO — READ-ONLY locals to IP-RELATIVE (the RW ladder's DUAL; this is what finishes r10 off).** Lon
  directive 2026-06-01. RULES.md **ICON READ-ONLY LOCALS ARE IP-RELATIVE FACT RULE**: a per-box compile-time
  constant — literal string bytes, cset pointer, a fixed bound, an op code, AND the resolved address of a runtime
  helper — is RO and MUST be reached by `[rip+disp]` into SEALED data placed adjacent to (within/next to) the box's
  own BLOB, NEVER by an absolute `movabs` immediate and NEVER from an `[r10]`-block field. Today the SNOBOL pattern
  **BINARY** arms bake their RO ADDRESSES as `movabs` imm64 — `bb_lit` `movabs rsi,&lit` + `movabs rax,&memcmp`;
  `bb_pat_any`/`notany`/`span`/`break` `movabs rdi,&cset` + `movabs rax,&strchr` (the matching **TEXT** arms ALREADY
  do this right: `lea reg,[rip+label]` / `call …@PLT`). Per box, move each baked ADDRESS into a sealed RO data
  trailer emitted immediately after the box code and load it with `lea`/`mov reg,[rip+disp]`, where `disp` is a
  LITERAL emit-time constant derived from the box's fixed layout (data and access live in the SAME box BLOB, so the
  disp is knowable by hand — FACT RULE TWO LITERAL FORMS preserved: the byte map stays hand-coded, only the
  addressing mode changes). NOTE — a small literal INTEGER operand (e.g. `bb_lit`'s `mov rdx,len`) is a normal
  immediate, NOT addressed storage, and is OUT OF SCOPE. **PAYOFF:** (1) conforms the SNOBOL pattern family to the
  RO FACT RULE; (2) makes the box POSITION-INDEPENDENT in the BINARY (mode-3 JIT) arm too — a SECOND contributor to
  lifting SNOBOL m4, alongside the `&Σ`/`&Σlen` removal; (3) with RW state now in ζ=R12 / Σ=R13 / δ=R14 / Δ=R15
  (the RW ladder above) and RO state in `[rip+disp]`, **r10 has NO remaining purpose** — the `[r10]` cursor-mirror
  writes and the `push r10`/`pop r10` guards around `memcmp`/`strchr` are DEAD and are removed here, eliminating
  r10 from the pattern family entirely (the RW ladder removes [r10]-as-cursor; REG-RO removes the last r10 traffic).
  Sequence: do REG-RO **after** the RW ladder (REG-2…REG-5) so each box is touched once; per box re-derive the byte
  map + patch offsets (the `movabs`+imm64 block, 10 bytes, becomes a `lea`/`mov [rip+disp]`, 7 bytes — offsets
  shift; verify with `as`+`objdump` exactly as REG-2 did). Gate per box; m2 7/7 HARD invariant. COMPLETION TEST
  (rung): no `movabs` loading an RO ADDRESS (lit / cset / helper-fn ptr) remains in the SNOBOL pattern BINARY arms —
  each is `[rip+disp]` into sealed RO data; **zero `r10` in ANY form** (`[r10]`, `push r10`, `pop r10`) in the
  pattern family; m3 ≥ floor; probes green.
- [ ] **REG-FENCE — the no-legacy-cursor / no-r10 gate (completion test).** Add `scripts/test_gate_sno_pat_reg.sh`:
  `grep -lE 'TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIGMA|TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIGLEN' src/emitter/BB_templates/bb_pat_*.cpp src/emitter/BB_templates/bb_lit.cpp src/emitter/BB_templates/bb_capture.cpp src/emitter/BB_templates/bb_arbno.cpp`
  == empty, AND no `[r10]`-as-cursor read/write remains in those files (cursor is r14, subject r13, length r15),
  AND (post-REG-RO) **zero `r10` in any form** (`[r10]`/`push r10`/`pop r10`) in the pattern family with every RO
  address reached `[rip+disp]` (no RO-address `movabs` left). Wire into the Session Setup gate list so it can never
  creep back. **Then RE-CHECK SNOBOL m4 smoke** — with the `&Σ`/`&Σlen` bakes gone AND the RO addresses now
  position-independent, the pattern boxes are relocatable, so the m4 0/6 floor should finally be liftable (track
  the new m4 count). COMPLETION TEST (rung): the new gate green + in Session Setup; m2 7/7 HARD held; m3 ≥ floor;
  SNOBOL m4 re-measured (expected > 0/6 once a pattern chain assembles+links+runs standalone).

**COMPLETION TEST (REG ladder):** `test_gate_sno_pat_reg.sh` green (zero `TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIG*`, zero `[r10]`-cursor,
and — post-REG-RO — zero `r10` in any form with all RO addresses `[rip+disp]`, in the SNOBOL pattern family); every
pattern box reads cursor=R14 / subject=R13 / length=R15 and reaches RO constants by IP-relative addressing; m2 7/7
HARD invariant throughout; SNOBOL mode-4 pattern smoke re-measured and improved (the process-local-address blocker
is gone). The convention TABLE is byte-identical-×3 and UNCHANGED (this rung conforms boxes to it, does not edit it).

## ⭐ SESSION 2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — GROUND-ZERO LOWER REWRITE (unified four-port AST→IR) — FOUNDATION LAID + PROVEN

**Post-PIVOT direction (Lon):** rip-and-replace the lowerer with ONE unified AST→IR pass on the Proebsting
four-port attribute-grammar model. SNOBOL4 pattern lowering (the legacy `build_node`) becomes the **PATTERN
role** of that unified pass. Ground zero — old build may break; old `lower.c` left untouched for now.

**Survey:** `src/lower/lower.c` is the ONLY real AST→IR lowerer (7 tangled `TT_` dispatchers). `prolog_lower.c`/
`rebus_lower.c` are AST→AST normalizers; `lower_sno.c` is a tree→`.sno` source emitter. 156 `TT_` in, 110 `IR_` out.

**Architecture — ROLE × kind.** One funnel `lower2(cx, e, γ_in, ω_in, &α_out, &β_out)` → branch on
`cx.role ∈ {VALUE, PATTERN, GOAL}` → ONE `switch(tree_e)` per role. ~2/3 of kinds role-monomorphic; only
QLIT/VAR/FNC + arith/rel (shared VALUE↔GOAL) split on role.

**Canonical signature = the attribute grammar** (jcon `ir_a_X(p,st,inuse,target,bounded,rval)`; Proebsting):
γ/ω (succeed/fail) INHERITED in as 2 pointers; α/β (start/resume) SYNTHESIZED out as 2 ptr-to-ptr. `IR_t`
ports are POINTERS → goto-chains COLLAPSE = the paper's Fig-2 optimization for free. Two template classes:
BOUNDED LEAF (`emit_leaf`, honors `cx.bounded` = jcon `/bounded`) + RESUMABLE GENERATOR. Discipline in 3
primitives: `nalloc`, `set_succ_fail` (default-only — never clobber a threaded port), `ret`.

**Landed (SCRIP `3c66694`, NEW standalone TUs — NOT in Makefile/driver, nothing regressed):**
- `src/lower/lower2.c` (358 ln, 0 errors). 5 FOUNDATION BOXES wired + PROVEN faithful to Proebsting Figs 1&2:
  literal §4.1, unop §4.2, binop §4.3 (plus+LessThan, relational flag `dval=1.0`), to/to_by §4.4 (ir_a_ToBy),
  if §4.5 (runtime-gated; E1 lowered `bounded=1`). PATTERN leaves (LIT/ARB/REM + SPAN/ANY/NOTANY/BREAK/BREAKX
  via centralized `pat_cset_arg` — the cset trichotomy that was copy-pasted 5× in legacy `build_node`). GOAL
  leaves (cut/true/fail). 118/156 kinds armed; rest = labelled stubs → LOUD `lower_unhandled`, each annotated
  with its `ir_a_*` source.
- `src/lower/prove_lower2.c` — topology proof harness (links lower2+scrip_ir ONLY; local `kind_is_resumable`
  + `cset_try_fold` stub so the old lowerer is NOT linked). Dumps each IR node idx + α/β/γ/ω.
- `src/lower/tmatch_proto.c` — `tm`/`tm_g` tree-pattern match+capture PROTOTYPE (compiles) + `#if 0` rewrite
  exhibit (foundation arms + nested `EVERY(ASSIGN(VAR,TO(lo,hi)))` + Prolog ladder in pattern form).

**PROOF (why this is a SOLID foundation, not a guess):** `5 > ((1 to 2)*(3 to 4))` → exactly **9 IR nodes**
(paper's "nine expanded templates"); **14/17 control edges == Figure 1**, the 3 = FAITHFUL Fig-2 collapses
(constant bounds). Proof CAUGHT a real `v_to` bug — wired both children's fail to outer ω; canonical
`ir_a_ToBy` requires **`to.fail → from.resume`**. FIXED, RE-PROVEN on `(1 to 2) to (3 to 4)` (paper §2
"initiated four times"): critical edge now `to2.fail → to1`. **Topology proven; NOT executed** — value-level
proof pending and depends on `bb_exec.c` honoring the relational flag (`dval=1.0`) + if-gate (`node.β` runtime
dispatch) as encoded — VERIFY against the executor, do not assume (RULES: consult canonical sources).

**Tree-pattern matching — WHAT IT IS (Lon's "two shots"; STEP 2, AFTER the foundation is complete).**
A lowering rule is really "*if the AST node looks like SHAPE, bind its parts and wire them*." Tree-pattern
matching makes that literal: a matcher tests a node's SHALLOW shape (its kind, optionally one child's kind /
an sval tag / arity) and **captures** the immediate sub-expressions into named pointers; the rule body then
recursively lowers the captured parts and wires the ports. This is the AST-side analog of SNOBOL `subj ? pat`:
the AST node is the subject, the shape is the pattern, captures bind sub-trees, ordered alternation gives the
"first matching rule wins" fall-through (the same effect as today's if-ladders).

THE FACILITY (prototyped + compiles in `src/lower/tmatch_proto.c`):
```c
/* match kind + arity, capture the first nargs children into (const tree_t **) out-params */
int tm  (const tree_t *e, tree_e kind,            int nargs, /* &cap0, &cap1, ... */ ...);
/* same, plus require e->v.sval == tag  (the FNC(",",a,b) / FNC("phrase",...) style dispatch) */
int tm_g(const tree_t *e, tree_e kind, const char *tag, int nargs, /* &cap0, ... */ ...);
```
`tm` returns 1 and binds the capture pointers iff `e->t==kind && e->n>=nargs`. Captures are the subtrees to
lower next (NOT yet lowered — capture defers, exactly like a DEFER pattern binds-then-matches).

THE "TWO SHOTS":
- **Shot 1** = `tm`/`tm_g` (match + capture).
- **Shot 2** = the per-role switch where each arm is `if (pattern matches) → produce wiring`.

WORKED EXAMPLE (hand-coded vs pattern form), the `binop` arm:
```c
/* hand-coded today (lower2.c v_binop): */
if (e->n < 2 || !e->c[0] || !e->c[1]) return NULL;
IR_t *E1 = e->c[0], *E2 = e->c[1];                 ... lower E1, lower E2, patch, wire ...
/* pattern form: the guard + the child-grab become ONE line that reads as the shape */
const tree_t *E1, *E2;
if (!tm(e, e->t, 2, &E1, &E2)) return NULL;        ... lower E1, lower E2, patch, wire ...
```
And the NESTED case (today a 3-deep manual guard at legacy lower.c:753) reads top-down as the AST shape:
```c
/* EVERY(ASSIGN(VAR, TO(lo,hi))) */
tm(e,TT_EVERY,1,&asn) && tm(asn,TT_ASSIGN,2,&var,&rhs) && var->t==TT_VAR && tm(rhs,TT_TO,2,&lo,&hi)
```
And the Prolog goal if-ladder collapses to a table: `if (tm_g(e,TT_FNC,",",2,&A,&B)) return lower_conj(...);`
one readable `shape ? builder` line per control construct.

WHY (measured on legacy lower.c): decisions are SHALLOW — 120 decision-peeks but only **12 sites peek two
levels**, **0 peek three**; wiring is uniform recursion (78 lower-calls, one per child subexpression). So
every rule = MATCH shallow shape + CAPTURE children + RECURSE + WIRE — exactly what `tm`/`tm_g` serve. LOC
shrink is ~30%; the real win is UNIFORMITY (every `e->n<k`/null guard vanishes into the match; nested peeks
read as the tree; dispatch ladders become tables). **Sequencing:** do this AFTER the hand-coded foundation
boxes are all in and proven — refactor proven code into pattern form, don't design two things at once.

ENDGAME: this pattern form is the bridge to an **Icon-bootstrap lowerer** — the lowerer IS an Icon program
over `tree_t` (each rule a SNOBOL pattern over `node.kind ++ node.sval` with children captured, Icon
alternation giving ordered match). Once Icon-BB executes enough, the pattern-form C transliterates almost
mechanically. (Parse symmetry: the parser is an LALR match tokens→tree; `tm`/`tm_g` is the symmetric match
tree→IR on the way down. DEFER symmetry: `IR_PAT_DEFER`/`rt_defer_match` is the runtime analog of a
compile-time capture.)

**Endgame threads:** (a) parse = LALR match tokens→tree; tmatch = SYMMETRIC match tree→IR. (b) `IR_PAT_DEFER`
(`rt_defer_match`) is the runtime analog of a compile-time capture — same deferral discipline, one level up.
(c) the pattern-form C transliterates to an Icon-bootstrap lowerer once Icon-BB executes.

**Next:** (1) add `Every`/`Alt`(first SIBLING-backtrack box)/conjunction, prove each via the harness;
(2) wire `lower2`→`bb_exec` on `1 to 5` for value-level proof + confirm/adjust the relational+if-gate encodings;
(3) rebuild program/proc walkers (`lower`/`lower_proc_body`/`lower_pl_predicate`/`IR_lower_pat`) → `stage2_t`;
(4) fill VALUE/PATTERN/GOAL arms box-by-box, grounded in `ir_a_*`, proven; (5) THEN tmatch refactor;
(6) later, Icon bootstrap. Refs: `Proebsting-...-Goal-Directed-Evaluation.pdf`, `jcon_irgen.icn` (`ir_a_*`).

**(The pattern-BB-template work below — BINARY/TEXT arms, mode-3/4 — is the PRIOR track and remains valid;
the lower rewrite is upstream of emission and does not change the BB/SM/XA template ladder.)**

## ⛔ MANDATORY READ BEFORE EVERY SESSION

> **⛔ READ FIRST for SBL-PAT-BB (modes-3/4 pattern work) — Lon "Eureka" 2026-05-31.** Before touching the
> SUBJECT/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT build path, read **ARCH-SNOBOL4.md → "Native pattern architecture — modes 3 & 4
> (pattern = built BB graph)"** AND **ARCH-x86.md → "Two block TYPES the emitter outputs (BB vs XA)"**. The
> active rung is **SESSION RUNG #0 SBL-PAT-BB** (below); first incomplete step = **PB-1 PATTERN-BUILDER BB** (PB-0 done, 179bf4d). Core idea:
> a SNOBOL4 pattern is a runtime byrd-box GRAPH — phase-2 lowers to BUILDER BBs that build BBs; phase-3 runs
> via a generic BB_MATCH box; later, INVARIANT patterns BAKE to a static BB. (PLAN.md rule 7 already routes
> MODE3/4-EMIT work to ARCH-x86.md + ARCH-SCRIP.md, both of which cross-ref the ARCH-SNOBOL4 section.)

**Pipeline:**
```
SNOBOL4 source → CMPILE parser → tree_t* → lower_pat_dcg.c (BB_lower_pat)
    → BB_graph_t (BB_PAT_* nodes, four-port-wired)
    → [mode 2] bb_exec.c: case BB_PAT_*  (correctness oracle)
    → [mode 4] walk_bb_flat → FILL → walk_bb_node → emit_core
               → BB_templates/bb_pat_*.cpp TEXT arm (inline GAS)
               → BB_templates/bb_pat_*.cpp BINARY arm (raw x86 via bb_bin_t)
```

- **Mode 2 (`--interp`):** `sm_interp_run` + `bb_exec.c` C oracle.
- **Mode 3 (`--run`):** `sm_run_native` → SM_templates BINARY arms → sealed RX → jump in. BB call-outs via flat-wired `bb_build_flat`. Opt-in via `SCRIP_M3_NATIVE=1`; default still `sm_interp_run`.
- **Mode 4 (`--compile`):** Emit phase uses TEXT arms → GAS → gcc link. Standalone runtime builds pattern blobs via `bb_build_brokered` → template BINARY arms.

> **⛔ TESTING DIRECTIVE (Lon 2026-05-31) — ALWAYS RUN ALL THREE MODES FOR THIS GOAL.** Whenever you test
> SCRIP, exercise **mode 2 (`--interp`)**, **mode 3 (`--run` / SB-LINEAR)**, AND **mode 4
> (`--compile --target=x86` → `as` → `gcc -no-pie … -lscrip_rt` → run the binary)** — every time, from now on.
> `scripts/test_smoke_snobol4.sh` now does this: mode 2 is the **HARD gate** (exit 0 requires mode-2 all-pass);
> modes 3 and 4 are **RUN + REPORTED on every invocation** (tracked with `MODE3_MIN`/`MODE4_MIN` PASS floors,
> default 0) so the full native picture is always visible. NEVER report a mode-2 number alone — always run and
> record 3 and 4 alongside it. (Mode 3/4 for SNOBOL4 are currently 0/6 — the `--run` native path and the
> SMX-4-excised `--compile` x86 emission are not yet rebuilt; the directive makes that gap visible each run.)
> Raise `MODE3_MIN`/`MODE4_MIN` as those modes come back so regressions in them also fail the gate.

**Absolute rules (RULES.md):** No C Byrd boxes. TEMPLATE-PURITY. ONE x86 PRODUCER. Stub LOUD via `bomb_bytes()`. X86 ONLY. MODE PURITY (no silent cross-mode fallback / no silent eps substitution).

---

## Architecture: what the x86 TEXT arm must emit

`walk_bb_flat` calls `FILL(nd, lbl_γ, lbl_ω, lbl_β)`. Template emits α-port code (fresh: match, advance Δ, jump γ or ω) followed by β-port code (retry: undo, advance differently, jump γ or ω; some kinds β = lbl_ω directly).

**Runtime state in TEXT arm:** `[r10]` = Δ (cursor, 32-bit int). `[rip + Σ]` = subject ptr. `[rip + Σlen]` = length. `nd->sval` = charset string baked into `.data`. `nd->counter` (int64) = runtime mutable state for generators.

**BINARY arm:** raw bytes via `bytes()` + `u32le(0)` rel32 placeholders + `bb_bin_t.sites` listing rel32 patch offsets. `movabs` for absolute addresses. Refs: `bb_lit.cpp`, `bb_pat_len.cpp`, `bb_pat_pos.cpp`, `bb_pat_any.cpp` (104B, sites {17,72,86,90,100}), `bb_pat_notany.cpp`, `bb_pat_break.cpp` (178B), `bb_capture.cpp` (128B).

**Per-node persistent BINARY storage (SHARED PATTERN):** brokered blobs have no ELF `.data`. Two patterns:
1. `g_emit.bb_cs_zeta` `rt_cs_t {const char *chars; int delta;}` — `delta @+8` for SPAN/ARBNO counters; baked via `movabs rcx, &zeta`.
2. Process-lifetime `std::deque<int>` allocator (e.g. `cap_alloc_saved_delta_slot()`) — pointer never invalidates, GC-safe via C++ heap. Use for SPAN-2 / CAP / BREAKX scratch.

**DO NOT** use `GC_MALLOC` for per-node scratch baked as imm64 — bb_pool is mmap'd, GC can't see the address.

**Semantic oracle:** `bb_exec.c case BB_PAT_*` — α (state==0) and β (state>0) logic.

---

## ⭐ THIS SESSION (Lon directive 2026-05-30): RENAME BB → IR (uppercase IR-graph constructs only)

**Why.** With the Stack Machine gone (SMX-4), the uppercase `BB_*` directed graph IS the
intermediate representation. Restore its historical name **IR** so the codebase visibly separates
**IR constructs** (the lowered graph — uppercase, → `IR_*`) from **emitted byrd-box constructs** (the
executable boxes — lowercase `bb_*`, UNCHANGED). The casing split (`BB` vs `bb`) already in place
makes this mechanically safe; `BB.h`'s include guard is already `SCRIP_IR_H` (residue of the prior IR name).

**Reliability facts (measured this session on clean `a0bb9be4`).**
- Target namespace is clean: the ONLY pre-existing `IR_*` tokens are `IR_IS_GEN_KIND_TO` and
  `IR_WALK_MAX` (macros in `emit_ir.h`) — no collision with `IR_t`/`IR_graph_t`/`IR_op_t` or any
  enum-member rename.
- The casing split is real and reliable: lowercase `bb_alloc` (pool allocator) ≠ uppercase `BB_alloc`
  (IR-graph allocator); lowercase `bb_node_t`/`bb_node_id` ≠ uppercase `BB_t`/`BB_node_alloc`. A
  `\bBB[_A-Z]` (rename) vs `\bbb_` (leave) regex cleanly separates IR from byrd-box.
- UTF-8 hazard: source carries `α/β/γ/ω` — every grep/sed MUST use `-a` / byte-level (the token `BB_t`
  never overlaps the Greek bytes, so a byte-level sed is safe and lossless).

### Scope tiers
- **TIER A — rename (Lon-named, definite):** `BB_t`→`IR_t` (1346 occ / 88 files); `BB_graph_t`→`IR_graph_t`
  (301 occ / 24 files).
- **TIER B — rename (CONFIRMED in scope; the IR node-kind taxonomy + IR API):** `BB_op_t`→`IR_e`
  (23) — enum-suffix convention `_e` (structs are `IR_t`/`IR_graph_t`, the node-kind enum is `IR_e`);
  the ~125 `BB_op_t` enum members `BB_LIT_I … BB_PAT_ATP` incl. `BB_GEN_*`/`BB_NFA_*`/`BB_CSET_*`
  + `BB_OP_COUNT` → `IR_*` (~1850 occ); `BB_LANG_*`→`IR_LANG_*` (27); IR API fns
  `BB_alloc`/`BB_free`/`BB_node_alloc`/`BB_lower_pat`→`IR_*` (~214). **Rationale:** leaving the node-kind
  enum as `BB_*` while the node type is `IR_t` (`switch(n->t){ case BB_VAR: … }`) reintroduces the exact
  IR/emit confusion this rename exists to remove — a half-renamed IR is worse than either pure state.
- **TIER C — STAYS `BB` (these ARE the emitted-construct layer, NOT the IR):** `BB_MEDIUM_*` (emission
  medium), `BB_MODE_*` (byrd-box execution mode), `BB_PLATFORM_*` (codegen target), `BB_templates`
  (template directory), the bb_*.h header guards (`BB_POOL_H`/`BB_EXEC_H`/`BB_BOX_H`/`BB_BROKER_H`/`BB_BUILD_BIN_H`),
  and ALL lowercase `bb_*` (324 identifiers — pool / broker / exec / templates / byrd-box). **Untouched.**

**Template boundary (Lon-clarified 2026-05-30) — templates are TRANSLATORS: they receive the IR
(`IR_t`) and emit BB asm (byrd-box x86).** So inside `src/emitter/BB_templates/*.cpp`, the IR-type/enum
tokens the templates CONSUME **do** get renamed (the 330 `BB_t`→`IR_t`, 134 `BB_PAT_*`→`IR_PAT_*`,
3 `BB_op_t`→`IR_e`) — that is the IR being handed to them. But the template MACHINERY stays `BB`/`bb`:
the file names (`bb_pat_span.cpp`), the `BB_templates/` directory, the `bb_*` function names, the
`g_emit.bb_*` fields, and `BB_MEDIUM_*`/`MEDIUM_TEXT`/`MEDIUM_BINARY`. Net effect on a template:
`bb_pat_span(BB_t * pBB)` → `bb_pat_span(IR_t * pBB)`, same file, same dir, still reading `g_emit`.
**NO `typedef IR_t BB_t;` alias** — zero `BB_t` remains after the rename (Reading X).

Behavioral gates MUST stay invariant under any byte-neutral change; any gate delta ⇒ a bug — revert that slice and diagnose.

### Slices (ATOMIC PER TOKEN — typedef/enum body + all uses change together so the build stays green)
- [x] **RN-IR-1** — `\bBB_graph_t\b` → `IR_graph_t` across `src/**` (24 files; smaller, first). Gate. Commit `RN-IR-1 BB_graph_t→IR_graph_t`.
- [x] **RN-IR-2** — `\bBB_t\b` → `IR_t` across `src/**` (88 files). Word-boundary exact (does NOT touch `BB_templates`/`BB_to_by`/lowercase). Gate. Commit. **[TIER A COMPLETE]**
- [x] **RN-IR-3** — `\bBB_op_t\b` → `IR_e` (enum type; `_e` = enum, distinct from the `_t` structs). Gate. Commit.
- [x] **RN-IR-4** — curated enum-member rename: the 125 `BB_op_t` values listed in `BB.h` (`BB_LIT_I`…`BB_PAT_ATP`) + `BB_OP_COUNT` + the `BB_GEN_*`/`BB_NFA_*`/`BB_CSET_*` members → `IR_*` (CONFIRMED: `BB_VAR`→`IR_VAR`, `BB_PAT_SPAN`→`IR_PAT_SPAN`, `BB_OP_COUNT`→`IR_OP_COUNT`, …). **NOT a blanket `BB_[A-Z]*`** — explicitly EXCLUDE every TIER-C token (`BB_MEDIUM_*`,`BB_MODE_*`,`BB_PLATFORM_*`,`BB_templates`,bb_*.h guards). Rewrite the enum body in `BB.h` AND every `case`/construction site in one pass. Gate. Commit.
- [x] **RN-IR-5** — `\bBB_LANG_(\w+)` → `IR_LANG_\1` (6 values: SNO/SCO/REB/ICN/PL/RKU). Gate. Commit.
- [x] **RN-IR-6** — IR API (CONFIRMED): `\bBB_alloc\b`→`IR_alloc`, `\bBB_free\b`→`IR_free`, `\bBB_node_alloc\b`→`IR_node_alloc`, `\bBB_lower_pat\b`→`IR_lower_pat` (watch: lowercase `bb_alloc`/`bb_node_id`/`bb_node_t` STAY); any remaining bare `BB` in comments/strings (the `(BB_t*)` casts were already converted by RN-IR-2). Gate. Commit. **[TIER B COMPLETE]**
- [x] **RN-IR-7a** (FILE rename — CONFIRMED, Lon 2026-05-30 "BB*.* files become IR*.* files") — `git mv src/include/BB.h src/include/IR.h`; update every `#include "BB.h"` across `src/**`, plus `Makefile` + `scripts/build_scrip.sh`. Guard is already `SCRIP_IR_H`. Gate. Commit.
- [x] **RN-IR-7b** (baseline artifacts — same rule) — the **1330 git-tracked `baselines/per_kind/**/BB_*.*`** files (x86/jvm/net/wasm × text/binary, named after IR kinds) → `IR_*.*` via basename prefix `BB_`→`IR_` (`for f in $(git ls-files 'baselines/per_kind/**/BB_*'); do git mv "$f" "$(dirname "$f")/$(basename "$f" | sed 's/^BB_/IR_/')"; done`). Pairs with RN-IR-4. NOTE: the per-kind diff gate is flagged STALE (SBL-G-2) so these are currently inert; rename keeps names consistent with the new IR kinds. No build gate (fixtures, not source) — verify `git ls-files 'baselines/per_kind/**/BB_*'` is empty. Commit.
  - ✅ **`src/emitter/BB_templates/` DIRECTORY STAYS `BB` (DECIDED, Lon 2026-05-30)** — templates are emit-side: they reach state only through `g_emit` globals, i.e. they live PAST the IR boundary, not in it. Not a `BB*.*` file, 140 path refs (src + Makefile + build_scrip.sh), TIER C. No directory rename.
- [x] **RN-IR-8** — zero-check + handoff. `grep -rhoaE '\bBB[_A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*' src` must return ONLY the TIER-C set (`BB_MEDIUM_*`,`BB_MODE_*`,`BB_PLATFORM_*`,`BB_templates`,bb_*.h guards); `git ls-files 'baselines/per_kind/**/BB_*'` empty. Full gate. `git pull --rebase && git push` (code repos first, `.github` last). Confirm `git log origin/main --oneline -1` shows the hash.

**Scope decision (Lon 2026-05-30) — FULLY SETTLED, no open items:** TIER A + TIER B are confirmed.
Enum members `BB_*`→`IR_*`, `BB_LANG_*`→`IR_LANG_*`, constructors `BB_alloc`/`BB_free`/`BB_node_alloc`/`BB_lower_pat`→`IR_*`,
and **all `BB*.*` files → `IR*.*`** (source header `BB.h`→`IR.h` + the 1330 `baselines/per_kind/**/BB_*.*`
artifacts) confirmed. **STAYS `BB`** (emit-side, reached only via `g_emit` globals — past the IR boundary):
the `BB_templates/` directory and TIER C tokens (`BB_MEDIUM_*`/`BB_MODE_*`/`BB_PLATFORM_*`/bb_*.h guards),
plus all lowercase `bb_*`. Ready to execute RN-IR-1 → RN-IR-8.

**✅ RENAME COMPLETE (2026-05-30, this session).** All 8 slices landed + RN-IR-8b cosmetic comment polish.
SCRIP commits `b2a13e2`(1)→`7cbd3c9`(2)→`2018dd6`(3)→`222755f`(4)→`8730787`(5)→`0466698`(6)→`15418a0`(7a)→`bc69550`(7b)→`9ff631f`(8)→`29aaac0`(8b),
on top of base `c334861`. **Zero whole-word IR identifiers remain as `BB_`** (verified: exact-111-member
grep = 0; `BB_t`/`BB_graph_t`/`BB_op_t`/`BB_LANG_*`/ctors = 0; baselines `BB_*` = 0). Every remaining
`BB[_A-Z]` token is emit/byrd-box machinery (Tier-C: PLATFORM/MEDIUM/MODE/WIRED/BROKERED/templates/LABEL/
PATCH/POOL/DCAP/BANNER/bb_*.h-guards/ENTER/ALPHA + the `BBCopyMap` Term-struct + box-descriptive `.cpp`
comments) OR the AST-layer `BB_DEFINE_NAMES` guard (ast.h — outside scope). Gates held INVARIANT every
slice: `make scrip` rc=0, `make libscrip_rt` rc=0, Icon m2 **6/6** (HARD), m3 2/6, sm_dead 1 (≤1),
FACT **6** (pre-existing baseline — predates `a0bb9be4`; my byte-neutral rename moved it 0). **NOT pushed
yet** (10 SCRIP commits local; `.github` goal-file local). Open follow-ups (Lon's call, NOT done): the
AST-layer `BB_DEFINE_NAMES`→`AST_DEFINE_NAMES`? and the vestigial `-DIR_DEFINE_NAMES` Makefile flag
(checked nowhere in src). NOTE the watermark's old "FACT 0" was stale.

## Active rung: M3-NATIVE-4 — per-language bring-up + corpus parity (SNOBOL4)

### ⭐ MILESTONE (2026-05-29 Opus 4.8): NATIVE-ONLY GAP CLOSED

After SBL-1010 + SBL-1016, the broad-corpus partition has **ZERO native-only failures**:
every one of the 28 remaining native FAILs **also fails in `--interp` (mode-2)**. Native ==
mode-2 oracle == **252/280**. The "knock down remaining native-only failures" objective of this
rung is therefore effectively DONE — there are no more native-dispatch bugs in the broad corpus.
All further corpus climb now requires fixing the **mode-2 ORACLE** (which lifts BOTH modes
simultaneously, exactly as SBL-1016 demonstrated: fix once, both modes gain). Verified via
`comm -23 native_fails m2_fails` = empty. To re-confirm: run the broad corpus under
`SCRIP_M3_NATIVE=1` and under plain `--interp`, sort the two FAIL lists, diff them.

### Next phase: ORACLE-PARITY (lifts both modes)

**Completed (mode-2 oracle + native, terse — full narrative in git log / HANDOFFs):**
- [x] VARIABLE-ARGUMENT PATTERN FAMILY (SPAN/ANY/NOTANY/BREAK/BREAKX/LEN/POS/RPOS/TAB/RTAB accept `TT_VAR` args, resolved late in `bb_exec.c`) + SBL-SIZE-SHADOW. m2 248→253, native 255→256.
- [x] ANY/SPAN w/ CONSTANT charset EXPRESSION arg; charset-EXPR / ARBNO-combinator brokered wiring (XDump).
- [x] SBL-ARB-CAT-BACKTRACK (mode-3 native + mode-4 flat); ARB-as-pattern-VARIABLE backtracking (mode-2 oracle).
- [x] DEFERRED capture-commit; POS/RPOS-NON-FIRST-IN-CAT; 1010 SEGV (OPSYN-alias recursion); 1016 EVAL SEGV (deferred-expr dispatch).
- [x] 046/047 TAB/RTAB SIGSEGV native (site off-by-one + RTAB writeback); SPAN already complete (SBL-SPAN-2 was phantom); nested XDSAR `*var` in combinator under sm_run_native (walk_bb_flat DEFER case + tree-route + 16-byte align) — native 223→243.
- [x] Flip default to native (getenv gate removed; honest `[NO-SM-BB]`, no fallback).

**Open (mode-2 oracle gaps — fix oracle first, native parity follows):**
- [ ] 1011_func_redefine / 1013_func_nreturn / 1017_arg_local — fail in BOTH modes (DEFINE-redefinition, NRETURN-as-lvalue, ARG/local introspection). Audit-only bucket.
- [ ] Pre-existing m2 oracle gaps (audit-only): rungs 044/045/046/048/052/054/055/056/057 — `bb_exec.c` POS/RPOS/TAB/REM/star_deref/fail_builtin gaps.

- [~] **FENCE-commit / ALT-fall-through (124 + 114) — INLINE class FIXED; DEFER-capture-resume blocker remains.**
  SBL-ALT-CURSOR-RESTORE + SBL-FENCE-SEAL landed: Δ-advancing single-shot leaves set `β=self` (re-enter to undo Δ on ALT fall-through); FENCE saves Δ on α, restores on β (commit). Inline probes pass m2. **Blocker:** 124/114 reach the ALT through a pattern VARIABLE (`BB_PAT_DEFER`); on `bb_exec_resume` the alt entry is alt1's capture node, which can't distinguish "backtrack" from "commit/regrow" (same `inner.state>0` ambiguity as SBL-CAP-REGROW). Capture-transparency prototype (`resume_at` + `g_resume_backtrack` one-shot) made 124 green but regressed 3 sealed-FENCE-via-var tests (over-reach: re-enters a sealed FENCE). **NEXT FIX:** gate the capture's backtrack-delegation so it does NOT re-enter an inner that wraps a sealed/exhausted FENCE (delegate only when inner holds a live backtrackable generator). Clean floor = `77a39e82`; minimal repro of the pure DEFER-capture-resume gap = p8 (`token=('if'.K|SPAN.I)`).

### ⭐ TOP PRIORITY (Lon directive 2026-05-30): Complete all SNOBOL4 pattern BB BINARY and TEXT arms for mode-3 and mode-4

Every SNOBOL4 pattern BB template must have a working BINARY arm (mode-3 `--run`) and TEXT arm (mode-4 `--compile`). No pattern primitive may fall to the `default: jmp ω` stub once this rung is done. Honest `bomb_bytes()` stub is acceptable only as a temporary placeholder while the arm is being written; a permanent `jmp ω` for a real opcode is a RULES violation once the rung is declared complete.

**Missing BINARY arms (mode-3):** SPAN (SBL-SPAN-2 — deque pattern), ARBNO (SBL-ARBNO-3 — deque pattern), REM, ABORT, FENCE, ALT (combinator EP-walk present but needs corpus validation), CAT (same).
**Mode-4 TEXT arm gaps:** DEFER needs alignment fix (`push r10; push r10` convention per SBL-CAP-OUTPUT-R10); SBL-M4-FLATWIRE — `--compile` must flat-wire at emit time rather than brokering at runtime.
**Work order:** fill BINARY arms first (SPAN → ARBNO → REM → ABORT → FENCE), gate each via `--run` corpus delta, then audit TEXT arms for mode-4.

### ⭐⭐ SESSION RUNG #0 (Lon "Eureka" directive 2026-05-31): SBL-PAT-BB — pattern = built BB graph (modes 3 & 4 ONLY)

**SCOPE: modes 3 (`--run`, BINARY) and 4 (`--compile`, TEXT) ONLY. Mode 2 (interp) is NOT in scope and
must NOT regress.** Full architecture in **ARCH-SNOBOL4.md → "Native pattern architecture — modes 3 & 4"**
and ARCH-x86.md → "Two block TYPES (BB vs XA)". The five phases of `SUBJ ? PAT [= REPL]`, each emitted as
BB(s) (the ONLY vehicle that does work in modes 3/4 — XA blocks only wrap/stitch):

> **THE EUREKA.** Phase 1 build SUBJECT (easiest) → SUBJECT BB loads `Σ/δ/Δ`. Phase 2 build PATTERN →
> **builder BBs that build OTHER BBs dynamically** (a SNOBOL4 pattern is a runtime byrd-box graph: `'a'|'b'`
> CONSTRUCTS). Phase 3 RUN pattern → the generic **BB_MATCH box** runs the SPITBOL ch.18 scanner over the
> built graph against the subject (unanchored start-loop unless `&ANCHOR`, four-port backtrack, NO value
> stack). Phase 4 build REPLACEMENT (can fail). Phase 5 do REPLACE (fails if subject not an lvalue —
> `"hello"`, `99`). **Build (ph.2) and run (ph.3) are GENUINELY SEPARATE.** The current mode-2 `IR_SCAN`
> super-node + hidden `IR_alloc` sub-graph is the WRONG layer (`sno_ring_to_tree` anti-pattern in the
> lowerer) and is NOT this design.
>
> **THEN — OPTIMIZATION (after ph.1–5 work): INVARIANT-PATTERN BAKE.** Collapse any maximal run of builder
> BBs that builds an INVARIANT pattern (all components compile-time constant: literal str/int/cset, fixed
> LEN/POS/RPOS, constant ALT/CAT of such) into ONE **STATIC pattern BB BAKED into the generated code**
> (emitted once as sealed data/code, no runtime rebuild). Only VARIANT builders (`SPAN(VAR)`, `ANY(expr)`,
> deferred `*EXPR`, indirect `$NAME`) stay dynamic. const subtree ⇒ bake; references-runtime ⇒ keep builder.

Each step's discipline: prove the four-port TOPOLOGY first (`prove_lower2.sh`: node counts + α/β/γ/ω), then
the BINARY arm (verify mode-3 `--run`), then the TEXT arm (verify mode-4 `--compile` → `as` → `gcc` → run).
Smoke target ladder: `S 'b'` (plain match) → `S 'b' = 'X'` → `aXc` (match+replace).

- [x] **PB-0 — SUBJECT BB (phase 1).** Lower the subject value-expr → a SUBJECT box that loads `Σ` (base),
  `δ` (cursor=0), `Δ` (len) into the locked registers / `ζ` frame. BINARY + TEXT arms. Prove topology on
  `S 'b'`; verify mode-3 `--run` loads the subject (disasm / probe).
  **[DONE 2026-05-31, Opus 4.8]** New `IR_SUBJECT` kind + `lower2_subject_entry` (lower.c) + mode-2 arm
  (bb_exec.c) + `bb_sno_subject.cpp` template (BINARY 58-byte + TEXT @PLT arms) + emit_core dispatch +
  `flat_drive_sno_subject`/walk_bb_flat case (emit_bb.c) + `rt_sno_subject_load` (rt.c, returns {base,len}
  in rax:rdx). Box stores Σ→`[r12+off]`, Δ→`[r12+off+8]` in a 16-byte ζ-frame slot (ABI-safe, r12 preserved
  by the flat prologue; per SPITBOL ch.18 the cursor δ is zeroed when the match begins, so it is the
  matcher's state — SUBJECT loads only the fixed whole + bound). **v_scan deliberately NOT rewired** (the
  mode-2 IR_SCAN super-node stays intact → zero regression); IR_SUBJECT is exercised by the prove_lower2
  topology gate (2 new cases) + a standalone mode-3 execution probe (`SUBJECT('abc')→SUCCEED` JIT'd via
  `sno_flat_chain_build`, ran, confirmed Σ base="abc" / Δ len=3). v_scan re-stitch to the five-phase chain
  is deferred to PB-2/PB-5 (when BB_MATCH consumes Σ/δ/Δ in one sealed sequence). Gates: prove_lower2 59/0
  (was 57), smoke m2 7/7 (HARD) / m3 5/6 / m4 0/6 (UNCHANGED), concurrency invariants OK, sm_dead 1.
- [x] **PB-1 — PATTERN-BUILDER BB, literal first (phase 2).** Lower `TT_QLIT` pattern → a builder BB whose
  runtime effect CONSTRUCTS a LIT pattern-box; the built pattern-graph head lands in a `ζ` slot. BINARY +
  TEXT. (This is the "BBs that build BBs" core — model the construction protocol here, reuse for all kinds.)
  **[DONE 2026-06-01, Opus 4.8]** New `IR_PAT_BUILD_LIT` kind (IR.h, append-only) + `lower2_pat_build_entry`
  (lower.c): `TT_QLIT` → ONE builder box, bounded single-shot (β=ω; a builder is NOT a generator). DISTINCT
  from the matcher-leaf `IR_PAT_LIT` the mode-2 IR_SCAN super-node consumes (stays intact → ZERO regression).
  `rt_sno_pat_build_lit` (rt.c) is VALUE-STACK-FREE — it wraps the proven `pat_lit` constructor and returns
  the built `PATND_t*` head (NOT the deleted `rt_pat_lit` vstack-assembler wrapper). `bb_sno_pat_build_lit.cpp`
  template: BINARY (40-byte) + TEXT (@PLT) arms, mirroring `bb_sno_subject`; literal is RO (`[rip+disp]`/movabs),
  built head is RW into an 8-byte ζ-slot `[r12+off]` (PER-BOX LOCAL STORAGE FACT RULE). emit_core dispatch +
  `flat_drive_sno_pat_build_lit`/walk_bb_flat case (emit_bb.c) + dormant mode-2 arm (bb_exec.c, concurrency
  completeness). v_scan deliberately NOT rewired (re-stitch is PB-2). Gates: prove_lower2 **64/0** (+1 BLDLIT
  topology: own α, β=ω, 1 real node), smoke m2 **7/7 HARD** / m3 5/6 / m4 0/6 (UNCHANGED), concurrency
  invariants OK, purity +0 (fail-loud is MEDIUM_BINARY-exempt), no-vstack `g_vstack`==0. **Mode-3 execution
  probe PASS**: `BLDLIT('abc')`→SUCCEED JIT'd via `sno_flat_chain_build`, ran with `rt_frame`, built a
  `PATND_t{kind=XCHR, STRVAL="abc"}`; disasm confirms stackless ζ=r12 frame, no value stack.
- [~] **PB-1-REWORK — SUPERSEDED by the CORRECTED PATTERN ARCHITECTURE (2026-06-01).** PB-1 as landed
  (`6483bb5`) built a `PATND_t` (the type slated for demolition) via `rt_sno_pat_build_lit`. Per the
  corrected architecture above, a pattern element is an EMITTED BYRD-BOX (`bb_box_fn`), not a `PATND_t`, and a
  literal is INVARIANT → it is the EXISTING `IR_PAT_LIT` matcher box (`bb_lit.cpp`) referenced via
  **`REF_INVARIANT`** as a sealed element, with NO runtime builder (Fork A/E). So `IR_PAT_BUILD_LIT` +
  `rt_sno_pat_build_lit` + `bb_sno_pat_build_lit.cpp` are to be RETIRED, replaced by `REF_INVARIANT` +
  `IR_PAT_LIT`. The `rt_sno_match_lit` ch.18 scan kernel (PB-2 prep, `PATND_t`-free, raw subj/lit, unit-tested
  7/7) SURVIVES as the literal element matcher's inner scan. **Done in PB-RB-1 below** (the rebuilt ladder);
  this row marks the OLD PB-1 superseded so its watermark "done" is not mistaken for the corrected design.
- [ ] **PB-2 — BB_MATCH box (phase 3). [RE-CUT — see PB-RB ladder below; OLD text SUPERSEDED.]** The MATCH
  PHASE survives but as a `bb_box_fn`-graph DRIVER (broker, ch.18 outer start-loop), NOT a `PATND_t` reader.
  The draft PB-2 (`IR_PAT_MATCH` + `bb_sno_match.cpp` calling a `PATND_t`-inspecting `rt_sno_match`) was
  REVERTED (uncommitted) on 2026-06-01 when the corrected architecture landed. `rt_sno_match_lit` (the scan
  kernel) remains valid. See PB-RB-3 below.
- [ ] **PB-OPT — [RE-CUT — see PB-RB-OPT below; OLD `tree_t`-bake mechanism SUPERSEDED.]** The OLD PB-OPT
  baked the pattern AST as a static `tree_t` and had ONE BB tree-walk-construct the graph from it. Per the
  corrected architecture, there is NO `tree_t` in the pattern path; the invariant fast path is the
  all-invariant single-sealed-BLOB freeze (REF_INVARIANT hands MATCH the sealed head). See PB-RB-OPT.

### ⭐⭐ REBUILT LADDER — PB-RB (CORRECTED PATTERN ARCHITECTURE, 2026-06-01)

Supersedes the PB-1/PB-2/PB-3/PB-OPT mechanism above (kept for history, marked SUPERSEDED). The matcher
boxes are the EXISTING `IR_PAT_*` templates (Fork C); the only NEW boxes are `REF_INVARIANT`, `STITCH_SEQ`,
`STITCH_ALT`, and the phase-3 `BB_MATCH` driver. Same discipline every step: prove four-port TOPOLOGY first
(`prove_lower2.sh`), then BINARY arm (mode-3 `--run`), then TEXT arm (mode-4 `--compile`→`as`→`gcc`→run).
**Mode-2 (`IR_SCAN`) stays intact and MUST NOT regress** (m2 7/7 HARD) — the native chain is modes-3/4;
full `IR_SCAN` retirement is deferred to PB-RB-CONV when the native chain has breadth. Each box reads its
inputs RO `[rip+disp]` (sealed head address, literal bytes) or RW `[ζ+off]` (built head, match state) — NO
`PATND_t`, NO `tree_t`, NO value stack, NO ring (PER-BOX LOCAL STORAGE + NO-VALUE-STACK FACT RULES).
Smoke ladder unchanged: `S 'b'` (plain) → `S 'b' = 'X'` → `aXc`.

- [x] **PB-RB-1 — REF_INVARIANT + retire the PATND_t literal builder.** Delete `IR_PAT_BUILD_LIT` /
  `rt_sno_pat_build_lit` / `bb_sno_pat_build_lit.cpp` (the PATND_t literal builder). Add `IR_REF_INVARIANT`
  (IR.h, append-only) + `bb_ref_invariant.cpp`: loads a sealed element `bb_box_fn` head (RO `[rip+disp]` /
  movabs) into a `ζ`-slot. The sealed element for a literal is the EXISTING `IR_PAT_LIT` matcher box
  (`bb_lit.cpp`); `rt_sno_match_lit` survives as its inner scan. lower `TT_QLIT` pattern → REF_INVARIANT over
  a sealed `IR_PAT_LIT`. Prove topology; mode-3 probe: REF_INVARIANT('b') yields a `bb_box_fn` head in its
  ζ-slot whose code is the `'b'` literal matcher. (No runtime construction — Fork A/E.)
  **[DONE 2026-06-01, Opus 4.8 — EMIT ARM + PROBE]** RETIRE half landed earlier (`6343198`: IR_PAT_BUILD_LIT
  family removed, lower2_pat_build_entry repointed to IR_REF_INVARIANT over a sealed IR_PAT_LIT, prove 64/64).
  THIS turn = the EMIT ARM that was the remaining work: (1) `bb_ref_invariant.cpp` BINARY (25-byte) + TEXT arms
  — load the sealed element `bb_box_fn` HEAD (emit-time constant: `movabs rax,head` BINARY / `lea rax,[rip+lbl]`
  TEXT, RO never on a stack) into an 8-byte ζ-slot `[r12+off]` via `bb_slot_alloc`, then `jmp γ`; β = `jmp ω`
  (bounded single-shot, Fork A/E — NO runtime construction). Modeled on bb_sno_subject.cpp; patch tuple
  `{19,23,24}/{γ,β,ω}/{false,true,false}`. (2) `emit_bb.c` — new emitter-global `g_emit_cfg` (exposes the active
  IR_graph_t to the emit path so a node's operand_aux sidecar is resolvable, mirroring bb_exec.c's g_current_cfg;
  set/restored in sno_flat_chain_build / _text); `pre_build_children` + `pre_build_children_text` recognize
  IR_REF_INVARIANT and pre-build its sealed child resolved via `bb_operand_aux_get` (NOT bb_pat_kid, PEERS RULE);
  the two SNOBOL chain builders run a REF-specific child prebuild (`sno_chain_prebuild_children[_text]`) GUARDED
  by `has_ref` so they stay byte-neutral to every prior shape; `flat_drive_sno_ref_invariant` resolves the cached
  child head and hands it to the box via `g_emit.child_fn`/`bb_child_fn`/`bb_child_lbl`. (3) emit_core dispatch
  was already wired (emit_core.c IR_REF_INVARIANT → bb_ref_invariant). **MODE-3 PROBE PASS** (committed artifact:
  `test/snobol4/pat_bb/probe_pb_rb_1_ref_invariant.c` + `scripts/test_sno_pat_bb_probe.sh`): JIT'd
  SUBJECT('abc') → REF_INVARIANT('b') → SUCCEED via `sno_flat_chain_build`, ran with `rt_frame`, result.v=1.
  **DISASM-VERIFIED**: REF box = `movabs $head,%rax ; mov %rax,0x10(%r12) ; jmp γ` / β:`jmp ω` — the sealed head
  address (a real BB-pool box) lands in ζ-slot `[r12+0x10]`, stackless (ζ=r12, `push r12;mov r12,rdi` prologue),
  NO value stack; and the loaded head disassembles as the EXISTING bb_lit('b') four-port matcher (δ from [r10],
  bounds-check vs Σlen, memcmp 1 byte, advance δ → γ). The sealed element is REFERENCED, not run (running is

  how the head box-graph is driven over Σ/δ/Δ via α/β/γ/ω; ground in the canonical Icon/Prolog brokered-graph
  pattern per CONSULT CANONICAL SOURCES) then **PB-RB-3** (BB_MATCH driver reads REF_INVARIANT's ζ-slot head +
  SUBJECT's Σ/δ/Δ and drives the ch.18 unanchored outer start-loop). NOTE on rebuild: `scrip` and
  `out/libscrip_rt.so` MUST be rebuilt in LOCKSTEP — a stale `.so` against a fresh `scrip` shows phantom mode-3
  failures (2/6); always `bash scripts/build_scrip.sh && make libscrip_rt` together before gating.
- [x] **PB-RB-2 — the matcher-box four-port ABI (drive ONE element).** Pin down how the four-port driver runs a
  single matcher element box (`IR_PAT_LIT`) over Σ/δ/Δ via α/β/γ/ω: α tries match at δ, γ on success
  (advance δ, leave span), ω on fail, β to re-offer (generators only). Ground in the canonical
  Icon/Prolog brokered-graph pattern (CONSULT CANONICAL SOURCES rule). Verify the existing `IR_PAT_LIT`
  BINARY/TEXT arms honor it (or adapt minimally). This is the substrate PB-RB-3 drives.
  **[DONE 2026-06-01, Opus 4.8 — SPEC + VERIFY, no code adaptation needed.]** ⚠ STALE REF FIXED: the step said
  "ground in `bb_broker.c`", but `bb_broker.c` (the driver) was DELETED in `646a543` (C-byrd-box teardown). The
  surviving four-port driver is `bb_exec.c` (mode-2 oracle); its `rt_sno_exec_scan` is the ch.18 reference driver
  (anchored/unanchored start-loop). Grounded the ABI there + SPITBOL ch.18 ("Pattern Matching" algorithm steps
  1-6) + the ratified X86-64 REGISTER CONVENTION.
  **PINNED ABI — see "PB-RB-2 MATCHER-ELEMENT FOUR-PORT ABI" block below.** Key result: `IR_PAT_LIT`
  (`bb_lit.cpp`) HONORS the port contract in BOTH arms with ZERO adaptation — α bounds-checks `δ+len ≤ Δ`,
  memcmps Σ+δ, advances δ, `jmp γ`; mismatch/overflow `jmp ω` (δ unchanged); β is bounded single-shot (`δ -= len;
  jmp ω` — a literal has NO implicit alternative). Verified vs the PB-RB-1 mode-3 probe disasm + a byte/text
  re-read of both arms this session. The whole SNOBOL pattern family (`bb_pat_any/pos/span/…`) shares this exact
  `[r10]`-cursor / `[rip+Σ]`/`[rip+Σlen]` model (grepped, uniform). **OPEN FORK handed to PB-RB-3 + flagged for

  Inline-jump (Model A). `flat_drive_match` (emit_bb.c) resolves the element from `operand_aux[0]` (PEERS RULE) and
  inline-emits it via `walk_bb_flat(elem, lbl_γ, match_advance, elem_β)`. `bb_match.cpp` BINARY: α loads Σ/Σlen from
  SUBJECT's ζ-slot (`g_sno_subject_slot`) + re-establishes `r10=&Δ` + seeds start=0; `match_retry` sets `Δ=start, jmp
  elem_entry`; `match_advance` (element-ω target) is ch.18 step 6 (`start++; cmp start,Σlen; jg →ω; &kw_anchor jne
  →ω; jmp match_retry`); β=`jmp ω`. Box de-named per Lon (`bb_sno_match`→`bb_match`, `g_sno_match_*`→`g_match_*`).
  LEGACY SUBJECT MODEL deliberate (Σ/Σlen globals + cursor in Δ via `[r10]`, the cells `bb_lit` still reads) until
  the REG ladder migrates elements to R13/R14/R15. TEXT arm = `bomb_text` stub (PB-RB-8). v_scan NOT rewired (mode-2
  IR_SCAN intact → retire is PB-RB-CONV). Probes (`test/snobol4/pat_bb/`, in `test_sno_pat_bb_probe.sh`, 3/3):

  `prove_lower2.c` `MATCH('a' 'b')` (PATMAT + wire_seq(IR_PAT_CAT) + 2 PLIT = 4 nodes) and `MATCH('a'|'b')`
  (PATMAT + wire_alt(IR_PAT_ALT) + 2 PLIT = 4) — `lower2_match_entry` calls `lower2(cx,e,m,m,…)` under
  ROLE_PATTERN, which ALREADY handles TT_CAT/TT_ALT, so the lowering/topology layer EXISTS; the genuinely-new
  PB-RB-4 work is the emitter-side STITCH wiring + mode-3 drive, NOT the IR topology. Remaining: add
  `IR_STITCH_SEQ` / `IR_STITCH_ALT`
  (IR.h) + `bb_stitch_seq.cpp` / `bb_stitch_alt.cpp`: read two child heads from `ζ`-slots, wire their four
  ports (runtime twin of LOWER's `wire_seq`/`wire_alt` — SAME port equations), leave the combined head +
  `{entry,exit,fail}` descriptor in a `ζ`-slot. ε-merge boundaries (Fork D; reuse `bb_nfa.cpp`). Lower
  `TT_CAT`/`TT_ALT` pattern → REF_INVARIANT children + STITCH (all-invariant case still wires instances; the
  BLOB-freeze is PB-RB-OPT). Prove topology + mode-3 `S ('a' | 'b')` and `S 'a' 'b'`.
- [ ] **PB-RB-5 — operand-variant element matchers (Fork A).** `LEN(N)`/`SPAN(cvar)`/`ANY(expr)` etc.:
  the EXISTING `IR_PAT_LEN`/`IR_PAT_SPAN`/… matcher box reads its operand late from a `ζ`-slot (operand
  produced by a preceding value box, ref via `operand_aux`). NO builder box — operand-binding only. Prove +
  mode-3 `S LEN(2)`, `S SPAN('abc')`.
- [ ] **PB-RB-6 — BB_PAT_BUILD for STRUCTURAL variance (Fork A/B).** `*E` / `$NAME` / pattern-valued var:
  `IR_PAT_BUILD_*` boxes that SPLICE (wire ports) the runtime box-graph (a pattern-valued variable already
  holds a `bb_box_fn` graph — Fork B; `*E`/EVAL/CODE evaluate/compile first via the `tree_t` path) and stitch
  into the surrounding sealed pieces. Prove + mode-3 `P = 'x'; S P` and `S *E`.
- [ ] **PB-RB-7 — REPLACEMENT BB (ph.4) + SUBSTITUTION BB (ph.5).** Replacement value-expr → REPLACEMENT
  BB (can fail). SUBSTITUTION BB: lvalue-check (fail for literal/number subject), splice
  `Σ[0:m_start]+repl+Σ[m_end:]`, assign back. mode-3 `S 'b' = 'X'` → `aXc`.
- [ ] **PB-RB-CONV — IR_SCAN convergence (retire the dual shape).** Once the native chain
  (SUBJECT→REF/BUILD/STITCH→MATCH) covers the corpus breadth, retire `IR_SCAN`: lower `TT_SCAN` to the native
  chain for ALL modes (mode-2 arm drives the same box-graph), removing the super-node + the dual shape. Gate:
  m2 corpus parity held; broad corpus ≥ prior.
- [ ] **PB-RB-8 — mode-4 parity sweep.** Every PB-RB box's TEXT arm assembles+links+runs; `--compile` smoke
  ladder green. Driver re-stitch for `--compile` lands here (LOWER emits the graph; no `sno_ring_to_tree`).
- [ ] **PB-RB-OPT — ALL-INVARIANT BLOB FREEZE (the optimization).** When a pattern is FULLY invariant,
  collapse its REF_INVARIANT + STITCH sequence into ONE sealed `bb_box_fn` BLOB emitted at compile time (the
  wiring frozen to direct jumps, no ε, no runtime stitch); REF_INVARIANT hands MATCH that sealed head
  directly. Variant patterns keep instance-level wiring. Gate: a fully-invariant pattern emits ONE sealed
  BLOB (verify `--dump`/disasm); native behavior unchanged (smoke ladder green). This is the MAX OPTIMIZATION
  — correctness (instance-wiring) first, freeze second.

### ⛔⛔ SESSION RUNG — BROKERED-MODE-ERADICATION (Lon directive 2026-06-01, Opus 4.8). THERE IS NO NEED FOR TWO WAYS TO ENTER A BOX.

**THE DIRECTIVE (Lon, verbatim intent):** "Any funky `int entry` MUST be gone. There is no need for two." A box is entered EXACTLY ONE way — a **jump to its α or β label**. The `(void *ζ, int entry)` **call-with-selector** is the second way, and the *existence* of two ways is the confusion. It is FORBIDDEN per the "NO C BYRD-BOX FUNCTIONS — JUMP TO α/β LABELS" FACT RULE at the top of this file. "Still compiles today" is NOT "needed" — propping the brokered path up to keep the build green is the exact green-build preservation that FACT RULE outlaws. **`bb_build_brokered` is NOT needed; it goes.**

**HONEST STATE (verified by grep 2026-06-01 — what `cc23c9f` did NOT finish).** The *driver* (`bb_broker.c`) and the C *functions* with the `(ζ,int entry)` signature were deleted. But the **emit-side brokered CALLING CONVENTION survives** and is the residue to eradicate:
- **`bb_build_brokered(IR_t*)`** (`emit_bb.c:~2196`, decl `emit_bb.h:13`) — emits a box with a `push rbp;mov rbp,rsp` brokered prologue (`0x55 0x48 0x89 0xE5`) in `EMIT_BINARY_BROKERED` mode, producing a `bb_box_fn` *called* with `(ζ,entry)`.
- **`EMIT_BINARY_BROKERED` (=2) + `g_bb_brokered` flag** (`emit_core.h:18`, `emit_core.c:18,30`) and the **`BB_BROKERED`/`BB_WIRED` macros** (`emit_core.h:55-56`) — **VERIFIED: the macros are read NOWHERE (pure dead weight).**
- **`BB_MODE_BROKERED`/`BB_MODE_DRIVER`/`BB_MODE_LIVE` + `bb_build_pure_mode`** (`emit_bb.c:~2230`; `g_bb_mode` set at `rt.c:201`, `stmt_exec.c:63`; branched at `stmt_exec.c:274,278,308,338`).
- **The actual `(ζ,int entry)` call convention lives in exactly TWO templates** — **`bb_capture.cpp`** and **`bb_arbno.cpp`** (`movabs rax, child_fn; edi=ζ; esi=entry(0=α/1=β); call rax; cmp eax,99`). These two boxes are the ONLY real reason `bb_build_brokered` still has live callers. (`bb_pat_defer.cpp` only ALIGNS for the brokered-child case in a comment + dynamic `and rsp,-16`; it calls `rt_defer_match@PLT`, NOT a child box — once the brokered-child context is gone, its alignment dance can simplify but it is not itself a brokered box. **`bb_ref_invariant.cpp` (PB-RB-1) is CLEAN** — it loads `child_fn` as a VALUE via `movabs`/`lea` and NEVER calls it.)
- The `stmt_exec.c:274-338` callers sit inside `exec_stmt`/`exec_stmt_blob` PATND paths that **already `abort()`** ("PATND->IR bridge removed"; `exec_stmt_blob` aborts outright at `:359`) — so those callers are dead-but-compiled.
- `bb_node_t {fn,ζ,ζ_size}` + the `bb_box_fn = DESCR_t(*)(void*,int)` typedef were KEPT by `cc23c9f` (the typedef slips past the FACT-RULE completion-test grep via `grep -v typedef`). The `int` param in the typedef is the last vestige of the selector; it goes too once no caller passes an entry.

**ORDER (FACT-RULE-sanctioned: convert the holdouts to jump-to-α/β FIRST, then delete the builder; a deliberately-broken build between rungs is acceptable, a surviving brokered box is not).** The STITCH_SEQ/STITCH_ALT graph-wiring of PB-RB-4 is what gives CAPTURE/ARBNO a jump-wired form to convert *to*; if BROK-1/BROK-2 are done before PB-RB-4 they must hand-wire the child inline (emit the child body in the same flat sequence, reach it by `jmp child_α`, take its γ/ω back by label) rather than `call child_fn`.

- [ ] **BROK-0 — dead-caller excision (free; no behavior).** Replace the `bb_build_brokered`/`bb_build_pure_mode` calls in `stmt_exec.c` (`:274,296,320,338`) — all inside already-`abort()`ing PATND/`exec_stmt_blob` paths — with the abort that already guards them (delete the now-unreachable `bb_box_fn bfn = …` lines). Delete the `BB_MODE_*` branch ladder (`:278,308`) and the `g_bb_mode` global (`rt.c:201`, `stmt_exec.c:63`) + `bb_build_pure_mode` (`emit_bb.c:~2230`, decl `emit_bb.h:14`) if no live caller remains. Gate: build rc=0; SNOBOL m2 7/7 HARD / m3 5/6 / m4 0/6, Icon m2 11/11 HARD — byte-neutral (dead code only).
- [ ] **BROK-1 — convert CAPTURE (`bb_capture.cpp`) to jump-to-α/β.** The captured sub-pattern is reached by emitting its element inline and wiring `jmp child_α` (fresh) / `jmp child_β` (resume on backtrack), taking the child's γ (matched → run the capture-assign, then this box's γ) and ω (this box's ω) by LABEL — NO `movabs child_fn; call rax; cmp eax,99`. The saved-Δ slot + `rt_cap_assign_cursor`/`rt_cap_assign_*` assign stays (that is real capture work, not a box entry). Both ASSIGN_COND (`.`) and ASSIGN_IMM (`$`) arms. Stackless `[ζ=r12+off]`, no value stack. Gate: the capture corpus (cross / W07_capt_cur / 074) holds under `--run`; m2/m3 smoke invariant.
- [ ] **BROK-2 — convert ARBNO (`bb_arbno.cpp`) to jump-to-α/β.** ARBNO is a generator loop: α matches the null string (SPITBOL ch.18 — ARB/ARBNO start empty); each retry re-enters the child by `jmp child_α` and threads the child's γ back to ARBNO's γ, child's ω to ARBNO's ω/exhaustion — all by LABEL, no brokered call. Keep the `std::deque<int>` per-activation slot pattern (real per-iteration state, NOT a value stack). Gate: ARBNO corpus under `--run` holds; m2/m3 smoke invariant.
- [ ] **BROK-3 — delete the brokered machinery + add the gate.** Now that NO caller passes `(ζ,entry)`: delete `bb_build_brokered` (`emit_bb.c`, `emit_bb.h`), `EMIT_BINARY_BROKERED` (`emit_core.h:18`, the `emit_core.c:30` case + the `:2201/2206` mode toggles inside the deleted fn), `g_bb_brokered` (`emit_core.c:18`) and the dead `BB_BROKERED`/`BB_WIRED` macros (`emit_core.h:55-56`), and the brokered `push rbp;mov rbp,rsp` prologue. Drop the `int entry` param from the `bb_box_fn` typedef + `bb_node_t` if no surviving signature needs it (else note exactly what does and why). **ADD COMPLETION GATE** `scripts/test_gate_no_brokered.sh`: `grep -rn 'bb_build_brokered\|EMIT_BINARY_BROKERED\|g_bb_brokered\|BB_MODE_BROKERED\|BB_MODE_DRIVER' src/ == 0` AND `grep -rnE 'esi, *1.*call|movabs.*child_fn.*call' src/emitter/BB_templates/ == 0` (no box entered by call-with-selector) — wire it into the Session Setup gate list so it can never creep back. Gate: build rc=0; SNOBOL m2 7/7 HARD / m3 5/6 / m4 0/6, Icon m2 11/11 HARD / m3 11/11 / m4 9/11; prove_lower2 64/64; concurrency OK; the FACT-RULE completion test (a) still 0 AND the new no-brokered gate green.

**COMPLETION TEST (rung):** `bb_build_brokered`/`EMIT_BINARY_BROKERED`/`g_bb_brokered`/`BB_MODE_BROKERED`/`BB_MODE_DRIVER` all grep to 0 in `src/`; no `bb_*.cpp` template enters a child box by `call` with an entry selector (every box reached by `jmp α`/`jmp β`); `test_gate_no_brokered.sh` green and in the Session Setup list; SNOBOL/Icon HARD gates survive. ONE way to enter a box, not two.

### ⭐ DESIGN QUESTION (Lon 2026-05-31, raised mid-SBL-M3-CHAIN): how do the PATTERN-builder BBs represent the pattern? — ✅ **DECIDED (Lon 2026-05-31): BOTH** — ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED 2026-06-01 (see CORRECTED PATTERN ARCHITECTURE at top): the pattern is a `bb_box_fn` byrd-box graph, NOT a baked `tree_t`. `tree_t` is for EVAL/CODE only. The `beauty.sno` / `tree(t,v,n,c)` memorial below stands as the AST shape for EVAL/CODE, not for patterns. History kept below.**

**✅ DECISION (Lon 2026-05-31): WE HAVE BOTH. This is the MAX OPTIMIZATION.** The two mechanisms are not
rivals — they compose:
- **The baked path (for INVARIANT patterns — and MOST patterns are invariant).** The pattern's AST is
  **compiled in / hard-coded as a pure static `tree_t` constant** (the `tree(t,v,n,c)` node — see below).
  **ONE BB** takes that baked-in `tree_t` and **builds the entire invariant pattern's dynamic BB graph from
  it in a single shot** (one tree-walk-construct). One box, one baked constant, the whole matcher graph
  materialized. This is the maximum optimization: an invariant pattern costs ONE baked AST + ONE builder BB,
  not N threaded builders.
- **The threaded path (for VARIANT parts).** Variable args (`LEN(N)`), pattern-valued var refs, and deferred
  `*E` stay as threaded builder BBs (the general PB-2 mechanism). They splice into / compose with the baked
  invariant subgraphs.
- **Classification (PB-OPT)** at lower time decides, per subtree, baked-invariant vs threaded-variant.

**Why this stays HONEST (the AST-prohibition is preserved, not broken).** The baked `tree_t` is consumed by a
**CONSTRUCTION BB** that *builds a pattern graph* from it — it is **never interpreted as the matcher**. The
matcher (PB-3 `BB_MATCH`, SPITBOL ch.18) still runs the *pattern graph*, never `tree_t`. So "one BB from a
baked AST" is real box work (construct), not the dead-mode-1 cheat (interpret `tree_t` as a stand-in for
execution). The prohibition's true line — *modes must never interpret `tree_t` in place of doing their job* —
holds: here the AST is the INPUT to honest construction work, exactly as it is for `EVAL`/`CODE`.

**🏛 MEMORIALIZED FOREVER: `beauty.sno` and `tree(t,v,n,c)`.** The baked AST node is `tree(t, v, n, c)` —
**t** = tag/kind, **v** = value (sval/ival/dval union), **n** = arity (child count), **c** = children array —
byte-for-byte the C `struct tree_t { tree_e t; union {char* sval; long long ival; double dval;} v; int n;
tree_t **c; }` (`src/include/ast.h`). That four-field tree representation comes from Lon's own
`corpus/programs/snobol4/demo/beauty/beauty.sno` (the SNOBOL4 Beautifier, 2002–2005; `tree.inc` /
`ShiftReduce.inc` / `TDump.inc`). `tree(t,v,n,c)` is the canonical shape of the compiled-in constant the
one-BB-from-AST builder consumes. *This will SCREAM.*

**The question (as originally posed).** The pattern-builder BBs (PB-2: "builder BBs that build OTHER BBs dynamically") must end up with the pattern's structure. Two ways Lon posed:
1. **BAKE the parser AST** — the parser-built tree (the exact `tree_t`) is baked into generated code as an RO constant; the builder references it.
2. **THREAD builder BBs** — a sequence of BBs assembles that same tree at runtime, each BB constructing one node.

**Context (Lon).** AST was historically FORBIDDEN because modes 2 & 3 would *cheat* — run the `tree_t` interpreter instead of doing their real job (the C oracle / native BBs). The dead **mode-1** WAS that `tree_t` interpreter (it lost its usefulness → removed; we'd otherwise have 4 modes). BUT **AST will legitimately be used in the backend for `EVAL` and `CODE`** (both inherently runtime-compile a string of SNOBOL source), "so why not PATTERN" — patterns are runtime-dynamic too.

**Claude's recommendation (now SUPERSEDED by the DECISION above — kept for the record).** Option 2 (threaded) canonical + Option 1 (bake) as PB-OPT, building a pattern-specific graph, never `tree_t`. Lon's crystallization sharpened the baked side: the baked artifact is the pure-constant `tree_t` AST, and ONE BB reconstitutes the whole invariant pattern graph from it — which is cleaner than baking a pattern graph (a graph has runtime pointers/allocation; an AST is a pure constant). Reasoning that still holds:
- **(a) Dynamic patterns force threaded construction anyway.** `LEN(N)` / `SPAN(C)` with variable args, `P1 | P2` over pattern-VALUED variables, and deferred `*E` (recursive patterns `P = *P 'x' | ''`) can't be baked. Threaded is the *general* mechanism; the baked one-BB-from-AST is the *invariant-subtree* fast path.
- **(b) The baked AST is consumed by CONSTRUCTION, never interpreted as the matcher** — so the mode-1 cheat does not return.
- **(c) The matcher interprets a pattern graph, never `tree_t`** — domain-specific, legitimate (SPITBOL itself interprets a pattern node graph).

**AST-prohibition refinement (ADOPTED with the DECISION).** *AST is permitted in the BACKEND for inherently-dynamic constructs — `EVAL`, `CODE`, and PATTERN construction (the one-BB-from-baked-AST builder + the threaded variant builders) — because there building/compiling from a tree IS the actual job. The absolute invariant: modes 2/3/4 must never interpret `tree_t` as a stand-in for STATIC code that already has a defined oracle (mode 2) or native-BB (modes 3/4) path. The matcher interprets a pattern-specific graph, never `tree_t`.*

- **SBL-SPAN-2 / SBL-ARBNO-3 BINARY arms.** Use `std::deque<int>` slot pattern from bb_capture.cpp (NOT GC_MALLOC). SPAN: TWO persistent int slots (z, z_orig); β yields successively shorter spans using ABSOLUTE z_orig. ARBNO: uses `nd->counter`, deque pattern + brokered child call. Validate via `--run`.
- **SBL-BREAKX-2 ✅ DONE** (2026-05-29 Opus 4.8). Own BINARY arm. TEXT β rescans-to-next using z_orig + z. z lives in [zeta+8]; z_orig recovered arithmetically (Δ - z) so no second slot needed. 302-byte α-scan + β-rescan, assembled+verified via `as`. Native +2 (W05_breakx, word4); zero regression.
- **SBL-ATP** (`@var` cursor capture). ✅ FULLY DONE (mode-2 oracle `877f61fe` + native template `745c7536`, 2026-05-30). Native +3: cross/W07_capt_cur/074. Key: `rt_pat_capture(kind=2)` builds `pat_cat(EPS, pat_at_cursor(var))` so XEPS must join XATP in `patnd_is_simple_atom` for the enclosing XCAT to be tree_eligible. ✅ COMPLETE (lifts cross/W07_capt_cur/074 native): (4) `build_patnd` XATP("@")→`BB_PAT_ATP`; `bb_pat_atp.cpp` TEXT+BINARY arms (model on `bb_pat_pos.cpp`; BINARY writes Δ→var int — add `rt_at_cursor` near rt.c:873); `emit_core` dispatch + `walk_bb_flat case`. Byte-producing → own session. (Interim: `BB_PAT_ATP` hits `walk_bb_flat default:` = honest `jmp ω` fail, RULES-OK.)
- **SBL-SM-BINARY (HQ-track).** `sm_pat_nullary.cpp` BINARY arm embeds emitter-process `rt_pat_*` fn-ptr as imm64 — Invariant-8 violation. Fix: call `rt_pat_*@PLT` directly.
- **SBL-G-2.** Re-freeze GATE-PK in `test_per_kind_diff.sh`. Baseline references deleted `rt_bb_*` boxes — stale.
- **SBL-LOWER-CLEANUP.** Delete `lower_subj_pat_split` + `lower.c:1750` duplicate after Snocone confirmed unused.
- **SBL-VERIFY-1/2.** Corpus climb after all BINARY arms + SBL-ATP: target ≥260/280 broad corpus.
- **Pre-existing m2 oracle gaps** (audit-only). Rungs 044/045/046/048/052/054/055/056/057 fail m2 too: `bb_exec.c` doesn't implement what rung suite expects for POS/RPOS/TAB/REM/star_deref/fail_builtin. Separate session.

### M3-NATIVE-5 (final)

Gate sweep + corpus, all langs. Honest failure for unbuilt opcodes.

**Mode-4 sibling (separate goal):** SBL-M4-FLATWIRE — `--compile` standalone brokers at runtime instead of flat-wiring at emit time. Defer until after M3-NATIVE done.

## Session State

Live HEAD is in the **Watermark** below; per-session detail (HEAD-by-HEAD writeups, gate logs, design
deliberations) lives in the `.github/HANDOFF-*.md` files. Only durable carry-forward is kept here.

**Done (structural, no logic change):** LOWER-MERGE LM-1…LM-5 (`9326db2`) — the four lowering files folded into
one `src/lower/lower.c` + `lower.h`, section order driver → Icon (the model) → Prolog → SNOBOL4 pattern → context.
PND-1 (KILL PATND_t lower bridge) — SNOBOL4 patterns lower `TT_*`→`IR_t` directly (like Icon/Prolog); the
`PATND_t` *type* removal from `pattern.c`/`rt.c`/`descr.h`/`patnd.h` is the separate Track-B runtime demolition.

**Open (ONE AST → ONE IR → ONE LOWER, Icon `lower_expr_threaded` the canonical four-port model):**
- [ ] **LM-6 (DISPATCH-UNIFY)** — collapse lower.c's three dispatch entry points (`lower_expr_threaded` [Icon] /
  `lower_pl_goal` [Prolog] / `build_node` [SNOBOL4 pat]) into ONE `tree_e`-keyed dispatch. Do AFTER all lower2
  roles are armed + exec-proven.
- [ ] **BOX-ZERO** — cut byrd boxes against the register-allocation scheme (Icon STACKLESS ONE-REGISTER FRAME,
  `[reg+off]` per-sequence frame distinct from r10/r13; RO constants IP-relative; no value stack).

## Session log (last few, terse)

- **2026-06-01 (Opus 4.8) — PB-RB-4 TOPOLOGY PREREQ** (SCRIP `e39c329`, pushed). `prove_lower2.c` MATCH('a' 'b')
  + MATCH('a'|'b') proofs (4 real nodes each, composite element γ+ω → MATCH). Finding: `lower2_match_entry`'s
  `lower2(cx,e,m,m,…)` under ROLE_PATTERN already handles TT_CAT/TT_ALT, so PB-RB-4's lowering layer exists; the
  new work is emitter STITCH wiring + drive. Test-only, byte-neutral; prove_lower2 65→67; all gates invariant.
- **2026-06-01 (Opus 4.8) — PB-RB-3 EDGE PROBES** (SCRIP `706d665`, pushed). Hardened the landed BB_MATCH BINARY
  arm: `probe_pb_rb_3_match_fail.c` exercises the two ch.18 step-6 edges the happy-path probe missed —
  whole-match-fail (`'z'`∉`'abc'` → start-loop exhausts → v=99) and anchored-fail (`&ANCHOR=1` suppresses the
  start-cursor slide → v=99), with an unanchored control (v=1) proving the anchor flag is the sole cause. Found two
  apparent bugs that are correct: `kw_anchor` is genuinely 8 bytes in the live `.so` (the `int` line is
  STMT_EXEC_STANDALONE-only) so `cmp qword` is right; `result.v==99` is the canonical FAIL code (xa_flat_epilogue
  fail_half), not garbage. Test-only, byte-neutral. Probe suite 3/3; all gates invariant.
- **2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — SBL-M3-CHAIN: SNOBOL4 MODE-3 RUNS FROM LOWER'S FOUR-PORT GRAPH (the `sno_ring_to_tree` replacement) ✅ mode-3 0/6 → 5/6**
  (SCRIP `7c26eb7`, base `641e45d`; .github this commit). The banned `sno_ring_to_tree` adapter stays deleted; mode-3
  now consumes LOWER's four-port statement-BB graph DIRECTLY via a new SNOBOL4 flat-chain emitter. **5 cases pass
  natively via `--run`: output `'hello'`, concat `'ab' 'cd'`→`abcd`, arith `2+3`→`5`, pattern `S 'b'='X'`→`aXc`, goto_s
  `:S(HIT)`→`hit`** (all confirmed vs SPITBOL oracle `/home/claude/x64/bin/sbl -b`). mode-2 **7/7 HARD held**; only
  `define` (user functions, IR_CALL+frame) remains for mode-3. **New (emit_bb.c, all SNOBOL-specific, byte-neutral to
  Icon — confirmed Icon m2 6/6 + m3 6/6 + m4 6/6 via `git stash` rebuild):** `sno_flat_chain_build(IR_graph_t*)` (BINARY)
  + `_text` (mode-4 future) mirror `icn_flat_chain_build` but (1) RESOLVE the `IR_SUCCEED` LANDING nodes transitively
  (`sno_chain_resolve` — a port to a landing follows through to its target; terminal `IR_SUCCEED` γ==NULL → success
  epilogue, `IR_FAIL` → failure epilogue), so the per-statement landing threading is transparent; (2) do NOT set
  `g_icn_flat_chain` (so `walk_bb_flat` takes the SNOBOL arms), instead set new `g_sno_flat_chain` (makes a standalone
  `IR_VAR` a by-name PASS-THROUGH — its value is read by-name in `bb_sno_assign_var`, so it must NOT push the excised
  value stack / `rt_nv_get` → `[SMX]` abort). Operand-ref pass `sno_chain_operand_refs(IR_graph_t*)` runs PER STATEMENT
  (`sno_stmt_operand_refs` over each statement-head = landing-resolved γ-target of entry + every landing) so statements
  reachable only via a failure/ω edge or a goto still get their consumer's `α` set (the `goto_s`/skipped-statement
  bug). `sno_chain_arity`: SNOBOL concat `IR_SEQ`(dval==1.0) = arity-0 LEAF (operands in sub-graphs) → `ASSIGN.α`=SEQ;
  `IR_SCAN` = arity-1 (consumes its γ-predecessor: subject for plain form / replacement for repl form) → `SCAN.α` set;
  else delegates to `icn_chain_arity` (covers the postfix LIT_I/LIT_I/BINOP/ASSIGN arith chain). Driver `scrip.c`:
  the mode-3 SNOBOL4 ABORT replaced with `sno_flat_chain_build(sbbg)` run under `g_frame_active=1` via `fn(rt_frame(),0)`;
  unbuilt shapes → SOFT honest fall (loud `[SBB]` stderr, clean exit, NO abort), so working shapes run while `define`
  just yields empty output. `bb_var.cpp` gained a `g_sno_flat_chain` pass-through arm (10-byte `jmp γ; β: jmp ω`).
  **NOTE — patterns run via the EXISTING IR_SCAN interpreter bridge** (`rt_sno_exec_scan`→`bb_exec_once` over the
  `IR_SCAN.counter` pattern sub-graph, mode-2's 19-arm engine, process-valid pointer baked imm64): this is the pragmatic
  static-pattern path, **NOT** the native PB-2/PB-3 builder-BB/`BB_MATCH` ladder (still future; see DESIGN QUESTION above).
  **Gates:** make scrip rc=0, make libscrip_rt rc=0, SNOBOL4 smoke m2 **7/7 HARD** + m3 **5/6** (floor MODE3_MIN raised
  0→5), prove_lower2 **55 PASS**, sm_dead 1 (≤1), Icon m2 **6/6 HARD** (byte-neutral). **PRE-EXISTING (NOT this session,
  proven via `git stash` at clean `8a01bb3`):** `audit_concurrency_invariants.sh` flags template-purity 7 > baseline 6
  (bb_assign/bb_binop/bb_call/bb_every/bb_field/bb_list_bang/bb_swap) — none touched here; my 4 files add ZERO purity
  side-effects. **NEXT:** (define) SNOBOL4 user functions in mode-3 (IR_CALL + call frame); then the real PB-0..PB-3
  native pattern ladder per the DESIGN QUESTION decision; mode-4 SNOBOL4 still 0/6 (driver `--compile` re-stitch is PB-5).

- **2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — SBL-M4-STACKLESS-1: SNOBOL4 MODE 4 LANDS (literal-assign) + modes-3/4 MISS diagnosed ✅**
  (SCRIP `80e6c22`, base `aa307b7`, rebased over `17096f3` RK-LOWER; .github this commit). Mode 4 **0/6 → 1/6**: `OUTPUT='hello'` emits a complete
  `.intel_syntax` program via real `scrip --compile --target=x86`, assembles (`as`), links (`gcc -no-pie -lscrip_rt
  --allow-shlib-undefined`), runs → `hello`. SAME box + SAME IR graph as mode 3 — proof that **modes 3 and 4 are two
  template arms (BINARY=m3, TEXT=m4) of ONE box, driven from ONE LOWER graph.** **The miss (now a top-of-file banner):**
  prior sessions treated m3/m4 as *driver* problems (the `sno_ring_to_tree` adapter; the `[SMX]` "not rebuilt" abort).
  In fact the mode-4 EMITTER was fully intact (`codegen_flat_build` + 15 XA templates) — only the driver *call* was
  severed. **Landed:** (1) EMITTER `bb_sno_assign.cpp` TEXT/GAS arm (rodata + `lea[rip+.L]` + `call …@PLT`, four-port,
  no value stack); (2) EMITTER `xa_flat.cpp` shared TEXT prologue+epilogue now honor `g_frame_active` (push/pop r12,
  no Σ/[r10] deref) — ROOT CAUSE of the 1st segfault was the `@PLT` store clobbering caller-saved r10 then the
  vestigial Icon epilogue deref'ing [r10]; byte-neutral to Icon; (3) DRIVER `scrip.c` mode_compile_x86 re-stitched
  (header → call-glue → main-close → codegen_flat_build → `.note.GNU-stack` LAST — the note had stranded the body in a
  discarded section, 2nd bug); (4) smoke link line += `--allow-shlib-undefined` (4 unreachable SMX-residue undefs in
  the .so). **Gates GREEN+INVARIANT:** scrip rc=0, libscrip_rt rc=0, m2 **7/7** HARD, m3 1/6, m4 **0→1**, prove_lower2
  **49/49**, sm_dead 1(≤1), concurrency OK, purity FACT 6 (baseline; new TEXT-arm byte-producers sit in the
  MEDIUM_BINARY-exempt path), Icon m2 **6/6** HARD + m3 5/6 (byte-neutral). **MODE3_MIN/MODE4_MIN can both go to 1.**
  **NEXT = pure LOWER+EMITTER:** lower `S 'b'='X'` (the `pattern` smoke) into the `test_sno_1.c` four-port statement-BB
  chain (subject-BB → LIT-match-BB → splice-BB), BINARY+TEXT arms each; both native modes pass from the one graph;
  then retire `sno_ring_to_tree`.

- **2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — SBL-M3-STACKLESS-1: SNOBOL4 mode-3 LANDS (literal-assign), STACKLESS ✅** (SCRIP `79e62f7`,
  base `7d3a15b`; .github this commit). First SNOBOL4 native mode-3 since SMX-4. **NO value stack** (Lon directive:
  "do NOT create a value stack. Forbidden!!!"). `OUTPUT = 'hello'` now runs via `--run`: m3 **0→1**. The other
  five smoke shapes SOFT-fail honestly (loud `[SBB]` stderr, clean exit, NO abort — the old `[SMX] FATAL` is gone for
  SNOBOL4; Prolog `--run` keeps its by-design abort). **What landed:** (1) `bb_sno_assign.cpp` — stackless box for
  `IR_ASSIGN` of a literal-string rhs: name+str baked as RO immediates, passed in `rdi`/`rsi` to `rt_sno_assign_lit_s`;
  42-byte BINARY arm (`movabs rdi,name; movabs rsi,str; movabs rax,&fn; call; jmp γ; β:jmp ω`); TEXT arm bombs
  (mode-4 excised). Touches NO `g_vstack`/`rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*`. (2) `rt.c` `rt_sno_assign_lit_s(name,str)` — stackless
  store via `NV_SET_fn` (OUTPUT→write-line, core.c:2397). (3) `emit_core.c` + `walk_bb_flat`: `IR_ASSIGN` branches
  SNO(`α==IR_LIT_S`)→`bb_sno_assign` vs Icon(`α==IR_VAR`)→`bb_assign` — Icon untouched/byte-neutral. (4) `scrip.c`
  `sno_ring_to_tree` (skip landing IR_SUCCEED, postfix-fold; recognizes ONLY `landing→LIT_S→ASSIGN→PSUCC` today,
  returns NULL else) + `mode_run` SNOBOL4 wiring → `bb_build_flat`, soft-fail on NULL. **Gates GREEN+INVARIANT:**
  scrip rc=0, libscrip_rt rc=0, m2 **7/7** HARD, m3 0→1, m4 0/6 (excised), Icon m2 **6/6** HARD (byte-neutral),
  prove_lower2 **38/38**, sm_dead 1(≤1), concurrency OK, purity **6** (baseline; the box's FATAL-guard `fprintf` sits
  inside the `MEDIUM_BINARY` exempt range so it is NOT counted). Local commits; NOT pushed (no handoff trigger).
  **MODE3_MIN can now be raised to 1.**

  **⭐ STATEMENT-BB MODEL (Lon directive 2026-05-31 — the shape for the pattern/goto/full-statement work; evidenced in
  the uploaded `test_sno_1.c`/`test_sno_2.c`/`test_sno_3.c`, which build the EXACT four-port goto-threaded form):**
  Treat **each SNOBOL4 statement like an Icon expression** — a four-port (α/β/γ/ω) BB. The order, per `test_sno_1.c`
  (`POS(0) ARBNO('Bird'|'Blue'|LEN(1)) $ OUTPUT RPOS(0)` over `Σ`/`Δ`/`Ω`):
  1. **Statement BB starts BEFORE the subject.** The outer BB's α enters first; the subject expression is evaluated
     inside it (`seq_α: seq = str(Σ+Δ,0)` then into the pattern chain). Σ=subject base (R13), Δ=cursor (R14),
     Ω=length (R15) — matches the X86-64 REGISTER FACT table exactly.
  2. **Subject gets ONE SHOT — no β-backtrack, but CAN fail.** The subject is evaluated once; if it fails, the
     statement fails to ω. It does NOT participate in pattern backtracking (no resume edge back into the subject).
  3. **BUILD PATTERN = a BB.** The pattern is constructed as its own four-port BB (each primitive POS0/BIRD/BLUE/
     LEN1/alt/ARBNO/RPOS0 is a BB with _α/_β/_γ/_ω; alternation threads `alt_i`; ARBNO carries `ζ`-frame `_1[64]`
     with per-instance slots — the `[r12+off]` one-register frame, NOT a stack). Built at runtime, OR
  4. **statically compiled** as an OPTIONAL optimization (the "2nd pass, optimization" block in `test_icon.c`/the
     test_sno programs — the pattern flattened to straight-line code when shapes are known at compile time).
  5. **Run the MATCH** from the built (or compiled) pattern BB against the subject; on γ, do the `$`/`.` captures +
     `= REPLACEMENT` splice; thread the statement's γ/ω to the SPITBOL `:S`/`:F`/`:(L)` goto exits (ch.4/ch.14).
  This is why `pattern` (`S 'b' = 'X'`, an `IR_SCAN`) and `goto_s` need: an `IR_SCAN` flat driver that emits the
  statement-BB (subject one-shot eval → build/emit the pattern BB → run match → splice) + `IR_GOTO`/landing
  threading — all stackless (`ζ`-frame `[r12+off]` + RO `[rip+disp]`), NEVER a value stack. The 19-arm pattern
  engine becomes per-primitive stackless BBs (model leaves on `test_sno_1.c`'s POS0/LEN1/alt/ARBNO bodies).

  **NEXT (next full-budget session, stackless byte-producing):** (1) widen `sno_ring_to_tree` / add an `IR_ASSIGN`
  arm for non-literal rhs (var, arith) — needs the operand sub-expr to deliver its value stacklessly (per-box
  `ζ`-slot, not vstack); (2) `IR_SCAN` statement-BB driver per the model above (the `pattern` smoke); (3) `IR_GOTO`
  + landing threading (the `goto_s` smoke); (4) SNOBOL4 user-proc call (the `define` smoke). Each: emit stackless,
  prove, gate (m2 7/7 HARD invariant; raise MODE3_MIN as they land). Recovery model = `test_sno_1.c` four-port bodies.

- **2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — MODE-3 SNOBOL4 ROUTING: SUBSTRATE DIAGNOSIS (superseded by SBL-M3-STACKLESS-1 above).**
  Lon: "Mode 3. Continue." Investigated routing SNOBOL4's `mode_run` onto `bb_build_flat` (the stated #1 next step,
  "Icon proves it works"). **Finding: the mode-3 native substrate is mid-GROUND-ZERO-3 migration and internally
  inconsistent — routing SNOBOL4 onto it now would route onto abort-stubs / a half-converted value-passing
  convention.** NOTHING committed (the real work is byte-producing → reserved for a dedicated session per the
  TEMPLATE-ONLY ONE-DISPATCH rule); recording the exact blocking facts so the next session doesn't re-spend a
  session rediscovering them.
  **Blocking facts (all grounded in source this session):**
  1. **Store/write/call runtime family is STUBBED.** `rt.c` `STACKLESS_ABORT` set: `rt_pop_nv_set`, `rt_pop_write_int_nl`,
     `rt_pop_write_any_nl`, `rt_pop_store_i64`/`_descr`, `rt_push_stored_i64`, `rt_call_proc`, `rt_call_builtin`,
     `rt_gen_concat`, all `rt_unop_*`, `rt_field_get`/`_set`, `rt_idx_get`/`_set`, `rt_list_bang`, `rt_limit_begin`,
     `rt_toby_real`, `rt_case_eq` — each aborts ("Icon value stack removed (GROUND ZERO 3); rebuild stackless").
  2. **Icon m3 5/6 passes ONLY via the `write(...)` call path** (write_str/int/string_op/every/arith) which uses the
     still-LIVE `vstack_push/pop` + `rt_nv_get` + `rt_nv_set` + `rt_arith` + `rt_push_int`/`rt_push_str`. None store
     to a variable, so none hit a stub. The lone m3 FAIL (`if_expr`) + the whole assign-store family are where the
     stubs bite. SNOBOL4 has no `write(...)` — it uses `OUTPUT = expr`, i.e. the stubbed/assign path.
  3. **Half-converted value-passing convention.** `bb_lit_scalar` IR_LIT_I (GZ-2) AND IR_LIT_S (R-HW-2) are now pure
     four-port PASS-THROUGHS (RO constants the *consumer* box seals `[rip+disp]`, NOT pushed) — yet `bb_binop`'s
     arith arm still POPS the vstack via `rt_arith`. So lits don't deliver a value the way `rt_arith`/`rt_nv_set`
     expect. The convention (value-stack vs stackless ζ-frame) is in flux and MUST be settled before any box lands.
  4. **SNOBOL4 IR node shapes ≠ Icon flat-template shapes.** `IR_ASSIGN` (SNO): `α=β=NULL`, value on the AG γ-ring
     (postfix), target name in `sval`; `OUTPUT`/`TERMINAL`/keyword writes route through `NV_SET_fn` (core.c:2384 —
     `OUTPUT`→`output_val` writes a line; the LIVE `rt_nv_set` calls `NV_SET_fn`, CONFIRMED reachable). But Icon's
     `flat_drive_assign` + `bb_assign.cpp` require `α=IR_VAR` and call the STUBBED `rt_pop_nv_set` → would abort.
     `IR_SCAN` + `IR_GOTO` have NO `walk_bb_flat` case (→ `default: jmp ω`). SNOBOL4 concat (`IR_SEQ`, `dval=1.0`)
     keeps operands in ISOLATED `IR_graph_t` sub-graphs (not the flat ring), and `flat_drive_seq` reads `pBB->α`
     (NULL for SNO) → emits empty-seq no-op. `icn_ring_to_tree` returns NULL on the SNO graph (entry is a landing
     IR_SUCCEED), so the Icon mirror falls back to `bbg->entry` (a landing) → walk emits jmp-γ → empty output.
  **The fork (Lon's architectural call — coupled to GROUND ZERO #1's shared register/ABI FACT RULE, x3 lockstep):**
  - **A — target the LIVE value stack now** (`rt_nv_set`/`rt_push_int`/`rt_arith`/`vstack_*`). Fast green on the simple
    expression-assign family, but builds ONTO the value stack GROUND ZERO 3 is removing → those boxes are knowingly
    throwaway (need stackless rebuild later). NOT lockstep (SNOBOL4-own box; no Icon re-prove).
  - **B — build SNOBOL4 boxes STACKLESS from the start** (per-box ζ-frame `[r12+off]`, no `g_vstack`; matches RULES
    ICON STACKLESS ONE-REGISTER FRAME + the goal's BOX-ZERO directive). Correct end-state, no rework — but means
    writing the stackless store primitive that `rt_pop_nv_set` is a stub FOR = a slice of the GROUND ZERO 3 rebuild,
    LOCKSTEP-shared with Icon (ABI change → all three GOAL files in one commit + re-prove all three).
  Lean = **B** (BOX-ZERO + the stackless rule are central; A's output is disposable). A is a legitimate stopgap only
  if a same-day mode-3 number is wanted (flag boxes for rebuild).
  **ORDERED PLAN (next session, byte-producing — pick A or B convention first):**
  (1) `sno_ring_to_tree` adapter (in scrip.c, NON-byte-producing, reused by BOTH A and B): skip leading landing
      IR_SUCCEED, collect the single statement's γ-chain to PSUCC/PFAIL/next-landing, postfix-fold by SNO arities
      (LIT*/VAR=0, BINOP=2, ASSIGN=1 with value→child + name kept in sval), return root or NULL (soft-fail) on
      multi-statement / IR_SCAN / IR_GOTO / isolated-subgraph-concat shapes.
  (2) SNOBOL4-OWN assign box `bb_sno_assign.cpp` (TEXT+BINARY) on the chosen convention — A: call LIVE `rt_nv_set`
      (32-byte movabs-name/movabs-fn/call/jmp-γ/β:jmp-ω, model bb_assign but `rt_nv_set` not `rt_pop_nv_set`);
      B: stackless ζ-frame store. + emit_core dispatch case + walk_bb_flat SNO-assign arm (lang-guarded) + Makefile
      RT_PIC_SRCS line.
  (3) Make IR_LIT_I/S deliver a value in the flat path under the chosen convention (A: restore the `rt_push_int`/
      `rt_push_str` push for the SNO path; B: seal RO + consumer reads `[rip+disp]`).
  (4) Wire scrip.c `mode_run` `!is_icon && !is_prolog` arm → `sno_ring_to_tree` + `bb_build_flat`, replacing the
      `[SMX] FATAL` abort, with a SOFT honest fallback (loud stderr "shape not yet flat-emittable", clean exit, NO
      abort) when the adapter returns NULL. Target: `output`/`arith` first (MODE3 0→2); `concat` needs isolated-
      subgraph flattening; `pattern`(IR_SCAN)/`goto_s`(IR_GOTO)/`define`(user-proc) are the LONG POLE (separate boxes).
  (5) Gate: m2 7/7 HARD (byte-neutral — SNO mode_run arm only), raise MODE3_MIN as cases land, prove_lower2 38/38,
      sm_dead ≤1, concurrency OK, purity (new template's byte-producers are MEDIUM_BINARY-exempt). Build: scrip rc=0,
      libscrip_rt rc=0. NO regression. Gates verified GREEN + INVARIANT at session start on `7d3a15b`.

- **2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — SBL-EXEC-4: SNOBOL4 KEYWORD-ASSIGN + COMPUTED/INDIRECT GOTO ✅** (SCRIP this handoff,
  base `81d721b`; .github this handoff). Two SNOBOL4 stmt-level features landed on the four-port IR; mode-2 stays 7/7.
  **(A) KEYWORD-ASSIGN `&NAME = expr`** (SPITBOL Manual ch.16 "Unprotected Keywords"). `v_assign` (lower.c) rejected
  any non-`TT_VAR` lhs → `&ANCHOR = 1` hit `lower_unhandled` (kind 47). Fix: accept a `TT_KEYWORD` lhs **only when
  `cx.lang==IR_LANG_SNO`** (FACT RULE: variation inside the one TT_ASSIGN case, Icon `:=` untouched). The lexer
  already strips the `&` (snobol4.l:154 `yytext+1`), so `as->sval` = bare keyword name; the runtime write path
  ALREADY EXISTED — `NV_SET_fn` (core.c:2403+) maps `ANCHOR/TRIM/FULLSCAN/MAXLNGTH/STLIMIT/CODE/ERRLIMIT/FTRACE/
  TRACE` → the `kw_*` globals and rejects protected `&CASE` (Error 10, SCRIP is case-sensitive). Same four-port
  topology as a var-assign (verified: anchored matching flips `"abc" ? 'b'` S→F; keywords round-trip; `&CASE`
  rejected). **(B) COMPUTED/INDIRECT GOTO `:($X)` / `:S($X)` / `:F($X)`** (SPITBOL ch.4). Used the free `IR_GOTO`
  enum slot (no exec arm, never constructed). **Parser fact:** `:($IDENT)` does NOT parse to an expr node — it
  folds to a `TT_QLIT` label STRING with a leading `$` (snobol4.y goto_label_expr:120); the rarer `:($(expr))`
  form (line 121) carries a real expr. So `goto_node_str` returns `"$L"`, NOT caught by `goto_node_expr`. New in
  lower_program.c: a run-time label registry (`g_bb_labels[]` + `bb_label_landing()`, populated after PASS-1 with
  every labeled stmt's landing), `make_computed_goto` (lowers the goto expr into an isolated value sub-graph on
  `IR_GOTO.counter`, like IR_SCAN/IR_CALL operands), and `make_indirect_goto` (the `$`-prefix string form →
  synthesize `TT_VAR(suffix)` → resolver). Wired into the U/S/F branch resolution. `IR_GOTO` exec arm (bb_exec.c):
  run the sub-graph, `VARVAL_fn` → label string, `bb_label_landing` → landing node, return it (unresolved/fail →
  `bb->ω` = the lowerer's fall-through). **CAUGHT A REAL BUG:** `bb_reset` (scrip_ir.c:201) zeroed `counter` for
  every kind except ARBNO/SCAN/SNO-SEQ/SNO-CALL → the resolver's sub-graph pointer was wiped on re-entry; added
  `IR_GOTO` to the preserve-list. All three branches verified (U/S/F → reached/hit/failure-routed). +1 prove case
  (`&ANCHOR = 1`, via new `dump_sno_value` since `IR_LANG_SNO=1`≠the shared lang-0 dump) + `kw()` builder.
  **Gates GREEN + INVARIANT:** scrip rc=0, libscrip_rt rc=0, prove_lower2 **38/38** (37+1), snobol4 m2 **7/7**
  (HARD), icon m2 **6/6** (HARD, byte-neutral — SNO-only guards), sm_dead 1(≤1), concurrency OK, purity FACT 6
  (no template touched). **MODE-3/4 ASSESSMENT (empirical, Lon-requested):** SNOBOL4 m2 7/7 (BB exec via
  `bb_exec_once`); **m3 = `[SMX] FATAL` abort** — mode-3 `--run` is gated `if (is_icon)` in scrip.c:478, Icon
  flows through `bb_build_flat`→`bb_box_fn` native (PROVEN: `hello from icon mode-3`, exit 0, icon m3 5/6), SNOBOL4/
  Prolog fall to the SMX abort (the native run-path EXISTS + works for Icon — SNOBOL4 just isn't routed onto it =
  the long pole); **m4 = blanket `[SMX]` abort** (scrip.c:396, returns before ANY emission for ALL langs incl.
  Icon — BB-native x86 emission excised by SMX-4, not rebuilt). **NEXT (high→low):** route SNOBOL4 onto the mode-3
  `bb_build_flat` path (highest value — Icon proves it works); rebuild mode-4 BB-native x86 emission; then
  `IR_PAT_DEFER` runtime (Track B), broader builtins (ARRAY/TABLE/APPLY), `&ANCHOR` already done.

- **2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — TESTING DIRECTIVE: ALL THREE MODES, ALWAYS ✅** (.github + SCRIP this handoff). Per Lon:
  every SCRIP test for this GOAL now runs modes 2/3/4. `scripts/test_smoke_snobol4.sh` rewritten — mode 2
  (`--interp`) is the HARD gate; mode 3 (`--run` / SB-LINEAR) + mode 4 (`--compile --target=x86` → `as` → `gcc
  -no-pie … -lscrip_rt` → run) are RUN + REPORTED on EVERY invocation (tracked, `MODE3_MIN`/`MODE4_MIN` PASS
  floors, default 0). Current: **m2 7/7, m3 5/6, m4 1/6** @ 18357d4 (the `--run` native path and the SMX-4-excised
  `--compile` x86 emission are not yet rebuilt — now VISIBLE every run). Gate exits 0 (mode-2 clean + floors
  met). The Mode-defs block gained a ⛔ TESTING DIRECTIVE and the gate-suite block was updated to match. Raise
  the floors as 3/4 come back so regressions in them fail the gate too.

- **2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — SBL-EXEC-3: SNOBOL4 PROGRAM-DEFINED FUNCTIONS + COMPARISON PREDICATES + RECURSION ✅**
  (SCRIP `cb5946a`, rebased onto `eccb4f6` PLG-3; .github this handoff). Mode-2 smoke **6/7 → 7/7** (`define` was the last fail).
  **(A) CALL LOWERING** — `lower.c` VALUE-role `TT_FNC`, `cx.lang==IR_LANG_SNO` arm → `IR_CALL` (sval=name,
  ival=nargs, `dval=2.0` SNO marker; each arg lowered into its OWN isolated `lower_value_subgraph`, the array
  riding on `counter`). The Icon arm (callee child c[0]) is untouched — the SHAPE split keys on `cx.lang`.
  `scrip_ir.c` `bb_reset` now also preserves `counter` for `IR_CALL(dval==2.0)`. **(B) FUNCTION REGISTRATION** —
  `lower_program.c`: scan `DEFINE('NAME(p..)l..')`, parse the prototype, and register a proc whose graph is a
  **VIEW** over the one landing-node graph `g` (`*fg=*g; fg->entry = land[label NAME]` — shared node set, own AG
  ring, distinct entry; no body extraction). `lower_sc` carries the saved-name list (params, then locals, then
  NAME); `nparams=#params`. Shared `RET`/`FRET` `IR_RETURN` nodes created up front; bare-subject and `:(L)`-goto
  `RETURN`/`FRETURN`/`NRETURN` wire to them (NRETURN→RET placeholder). **(C) CALL EXEC** — `bb_exec.c` `IR_CALL`
  `dval==2.0`: evaluate the arg sub-graphs (a failing arg fails the call); a proc-table user function runs through
  the **SNOBOL4 global save/restore frame** (save the globals named in `lower_sc`, bind dummy args to actuals,
  null locals+result var, push an EMPTY-scope `GenFrame` so the body's vars route through the global name table,
  snapshot/reset/`bb_exec_once(fg)`, capture `g_ir_return_val` on `FRAME.returning`, restore globals LIFO); any
  other name falls to `try_call_builtin_by_name`. **AG-ring save/restore around the nested call** (the ring is
  graph-level state `bb_snapshot/restore_state` don't cover, and recursion re-enters the SAME view graph) — this
  is what makes `N * FACT(N-1)` survive the recursive descent. `IR_RETURN` now branches on `dval`: `1.0`=value is
  the function-named global (RETURN), `2.0`=failure (FRETURN), else generic α-return (Icon/Prolog). **(D)
  PREDICATES** — `gen_runtime.c try_call_builtin_by_name`: numeric `EQ/NE/LT/LE/GT/GE` + lexical
  `LGT/LLT/LGE/LLE/LEQ/LNE` comparison FUNCTIONS (null string on success, FAIL otherwise) beside the existing
  relational OPERATORS; these were newly reachable (TT_FNC used to hit `lower_unhandled`) and are needed by the
  recursion base case. **Verified:** `DOUBLE(21)`→42, `FACT(5)`→120, `T(0)/T(5)`→1/99, top-level `EQ(0,0)`→equal.
  **Gates GREEN:** scrip rc=0, libscrip_rt rc=0, prove_lower2 37/37, sm_dead 1(≤1), purity FACT 6 (byte-neutral —
  no template touched), concurrency OK, Icon m2 6/6 (HARD), Prolog m2 3/5 (eccb4f6 PLG-3 lifted +1). All SNOBOL4-gated edits are
  byte-neutral for Icon/Prolog by construction (lang/dval guards). **NEXT:** `&ANCHOR`/keyword-assign, computed/
  indirect goto `:($X)`, true NRETURN (return-by-name) + DEFINE 2nd-arg entry-label, the `IR_BINOP` multi-node
  AG-ring fragility (`(10+20)+(3+4)`→11; same sub-graph fix as IR_SEQ), `IR_PAT_DEFER` runtime (Track B), broader
  SNOBOL4 builtin coverage (ARRAY/TABLE/APPLY/…).

- **2026-05-31 Opus 4.8 — SBL-EXEC-2: SNOBOL4 CONCAT + GOTO ✅** (SCRIP `687aa58`, base `f4f4d9a`; .github this
  handoff). Mode-2 smoke **4/7 → 6/7** (only `define` left). **(A) CONCAT** — Lon's steer: `TT_SEQ` → `IR_SEQ`,
  not a BINOP fold. `v_conj` branches `cx.lang==IR_LANG_SNO` → left-assoc binary `IR_SEQ` chain; each node lowers
  its 2 operands into ISOLATED `IR_graph_t` sub-graphs (`lower_value_subgraph`, γ=NULL terminal value-node) and
  the `bb_exec.c IR_SEQ` arm (marker `dval==1.0`) runs each via `bb_exec_once` + `binop_apply(BINOP_CONCAT)`.
  Robust for multi-node operands (`(2+3) ' ' (4+5)`→`5 9`; `(10+20) ' x ' (3+4)`→`30 x 7`; vars→foobar/foo-bar).
  `bb_reset` preserves `counter` for SNO-concat `IR_SEQ`. Value-role `TT_ALT`→`v_alt`→`IR_ALT` added too.
  **FINDING: `IR_BINOP` has the SAME AG-ring multi-node fragility** (`(10+20)+(3+4)`→11, not 37) — apply the
  sub-graph fix there later. **(C) GOTO** — `lower_program.c` SNOBOL4 walker rewritten: two-pass LANDING-NODE
  scheme (every stmt gets an `IR_SUCCEED` landing; label→landing map; `:S`/`:F`/`:(L)` resolve fwd+bwd with
  SPITBOL ch.4 precedence; subject-less bare-goto/END transfer via landing; entry=`land[0]`). Verified S/F/
  unconditional/backward-loop/combined. **Concurrency-audit false-positive FIXED** (`g_term`/`g_builtin` Prolog
  helpers between `lower_pattern`/`lower_goal` were misattributed to block#2 → bogus `TT_QLIT`/`TT_VAR` dup): the
  LOWER(a) awk now scopes counting to the 3 role dispatchers (`in_role`); still catches a real injected dup.
  **Gates GREEN:** scrip rc=0, libscrip_rt rc=0, prove_lower2 35/0, sm_dead OK, purity 6 (byte-neutral),
  concurrency OK, Icon m2 5/6 (HARD, byte-neutral via stash). **NEXT:** DEFINE/`TT_FNC` user functions (the last
  smoke fail — call frame + param binding + RETURN; `INVOKE_fn`/`IR_CALL` are refs), `&ANCHOR=N` keyword-assign,
  computed goto, `IR_PAT_DEFER` runtime (Track B).

- **2026-05-31 Opus 4.8 — REGISTER CONVENTION LOCKED IN CODE + SNOBOL4 PATTERN LEAVES ✅** (this handoff). Lon: cover
  the register base before the 3-session race, "SET the registers up front in the code before we JUMP into BB land."
  **Findings:** (1) the x86 BB-native emission backend is EXCISED by SMX-4 (`--compile` says "BB-native x86 emission not
  yet rebuilt"; `--run` silent; `bb_program` was an unwired empty stub) — so emitted bytes are assemble-verifiable only,
  not run-provable; rebuilding it IS the race. (2) THREE contradictory register conventions existed: GOAL FACT RULE
  (r12=ζ, r13/r14/r15=Σ/δ/Δ) vs REGISTER-LAYOUT.md (r12=SM value-stack TOS, r13-15 free) vs RULES.md ICON-STACKLESS
  ("r13=SM-state register") — all SMX-4 residue (SM engine gone → no value-stack, no SM-state). **Lon ratified the GOAL
  FACT RULE as winner.** **Done:** created `src/emitter/bb_regs.h` — THE single register source the 3 sessions reference
  (BBREG_* GAS names + BBREGN_* reg numbers); filled `bb_program.cpp` with the register-setup prologue (mov r12,rsp;
  lea r10,[rip+Δ_root_data]; jmp root α) — assemble-verified via `as` (`49 89 e4`/`4c 8d 15…`); synced REGISTER-LAYOUT.md
  to the live convention (supersession banner + table). **Lon register decisions captured:** rbx=DESCR base pointer
  (dual-width 8/16-byte DESCR; concurrent 32-bit session in flight), rbp=variable hash-table base (RESERVED — GET/SET
  stay C calls for now, inlining is a future optimization). ζ (r12) = ONE load per BB-BLOB sequence BEGIN, amortized
  across the sequence's boxes, survives C calls (callee-saved); R10 = caller-saved re-loadable constant data (flat) — the
  RO-const-vs-RW-dynamic axis is why ζ is callee-saved and r10 caller-saved. **SNOBOL4 PATTERN leaves added to lower.c
  `lower_pattern`:** LEN/POS/RPOS/TAB/RTAB/FENCE/ABORT/FAIL/SUCCEED/ARBNO + captures (COND/IMMED/CURSOR) + DEFER(*var) +
  bare VAR; `kind_is_resumable` extended with the pattern generators. Flag/payload encodings match the bb_exec.c oracle
  arms. **Gates green throughout:** make scrip rc=0, make libscrip_rt rc=0, prove_lower2.sh 17/17, purity FACT 6, sm_dead
  1, concurrency invariants OK. **OPEN:** (a) the pattern leaves are NOT YET PROVEN (no prove_lower2.c cases — next step);
  (b) R10 flat-data-ptr vs brokered-current-node fork is the one unresolved byte-affecting decision; (c) the 3 GOAL-file
  register FACT tables (byte-identical x3) now LAG bb_regs.h — a lockstep amendment is deferred until R10 settles + the
  dual-width session's rbx work lands (co-owned). Per Lon: do not tangle on the HASH inline optimization now.

- **2026-05-31 Opus 4.8 — CONCURRENCY GROUND RULES for 3-session LOWER+EMITTER fill ✅** (SCRIP `d1c082f`,
  .github `0b3e3bea`). Lon greenlit firing up 3 concurrent sessions (SNOBOL4/Icon/Prolog) to fill LOWER + EMITTER
  to 100% BBs on x86 by EOD, all platforms next; asked to verify the herding discipline first ("LOWER turning into
  a mess and code flying outside EMITTERS"). **Audit:** LOWER already herded (SHARED-LOWERER FACT RULE, verified
  byte-identical x3 — the earlier sed mismatch was a false alarm, the phrase recurs in this file's watermark). **Gap:
  EMITTER had NO concurrency rule** — `emit_core.c` is one giant shared `switch` (108 cases), 67 per-box template
  `.cpp`s, one shared Makefile `RT_PIC_SRCS`; RULES.md TEMPLATE-ONLY governed only WHERE bytes live. **Installed:**
  (1) `TEMPLATE-ONLY EMISSION — ONE-DISPATCH CONCURRENCY` FACT RULE, byte-identical x3 (md5 307534d6), mirroring the
  LOWER rule. (2) `scripts/audit_concurrency_invariants.sh` — the herding gate enforcing both rules' completion tests
  (no dup `case TT_` per role switch, no dup `case IR_` in emit_core.c, no byte-emitter regression vs baseline 6,
  FACT RULE blocks byte-identical x3 via awk). (3) `prove_lower2.c` `main()` sectioned per-language (BEGIN/END markers)
  so concurrent appends auto-merge. (4) Fixed the LOWER rule's self-check (c) sed→awk (over-matched in SNOBOL4-BB),
  re-synced byte-identical x3 (md5 5097ed94). Gates green: audit_concurrency_invariants OK, prove_lower2.sh 17/17,
  make scrip rc=0. No code logic changed (rules + gate + harness sectioning only); Icon m2 stays 5/6.

- **2026-05-31 Opus 4.8 — ICON EXECUTES AGAIN (m2 0/6 → 5/6) ✅** (SCRIP `212ed70`, base `593fbf3`; .github this
  handoff). Continuation of the shared-combinator session (Lon: "Finish."). Made Icon run on the four-port IR via
  `bb_exec_once(main)`. (1) Promoted `g_det_builtin1` → SHARED role-agnostic `wire_det_builtin1`, called from BOTH
  the Icon VALUE role (write/writes) AND the Prolog GOAL role (write/writeln/print) — another sharing seam. Set
  `dval=1.0` (is_deep) so the IR_CALL exec arm reads the threaded arg from the AG ring (verified `bb_exec_once`
  pushes each node value between steps). (2) Added the VALUE-role `TT_FNC` write arm; the per-language TT_FNC SHAPE
  is handled inside the one case (FACT RULE: variation lives in the case) — Icon carries the callee as child
  c[0]=TT_VAR with args c[1..], Prolog carries it in sval. (3) `lower_icon_body` (lower_program.c): builds each
  registered Icon proc's four-port graph from the TT_PROC_DECL body (c[2]), reverse-threads its statements
  VALUE-role, fills proc_table bb_idx. FAIL-LOUD — any unhandled statement sinks the whole body (-1) so the driver
  keeps its clean `[IBB] FATAL` rather than silently running a partial graph (verified: `write("one"); x:=[1,2,3]`
  aborts with NO partial output, satisfying the concern that made me revert this in the prior handoff). (4)
  **`tt_to_binop` fix** — `v_binop` stored the raw `tree_e` in `ival`, but the IR_BINOP exec arm casts ival to
  `BinopKind` (TT_ADD=13 ≠ BINOP_ADD=0) → binop_apply computed the wrong op. Latent since the lower2 rewrite (only
  topology was ever proven); Icon arith is the first executor. Added a tree_e→BinopKind mapper; this also fixes
  SNOBOL4 value binops (`OUTPUT = 2 + 3`→5, was wrong). **Icon m2 now 5/6** (write_str/write_int/arith/string_op/
  if_expr); the lone fail `every write(1 to 3)` (outputs `1`) needs generator-through-call resumption (L2-E
  suspend/resume frame) — IMMEDIATE NEXT in the Watermark. Gates: make scrip rc=0, make libscrip_rt rc=0,
  prove_lower2.sh 17/17, sm_dead 1, FACT 6. corpus UNTOUCHED. bb_exec.c UNTOUCHED. FACT RULE block byte-identical
  across the 3 goal files preserved.

## ⭐ SESSION 2026-05-31 (Opus 4.8) — LOWER2 BOX LADDER: proof gate restored + L2-A/L2-B-core proven

**Directive (Lon):** continue lower2.c; read Proebsting + irgen.icn (+ found: GOAL-LOWER-REDESIGN.md §318 wiring
table — the authoritative cross-check); implement all TT_* kinds; rungs in small proven groups; read the
tree-pattern notes. **Read this session:** Proebsting §4.1–4.6+Figs1&2, `jcon_irgen.icn` ir_a_Every/Alt/
conjunction/Limitation/While/Until/Repeat/Not, `lower.c` lower_new_*_ag (exec-compat reference),
GOAL-LOWER-REDESIGN.md (the four-port node §204, canonical wiring table §318, "lower wires the DCG directly"
§759, final pipeline §788). **NOT yet read** (next session): GOAL-SM-LOWER-REFACTOR.md, GOAL-ICON-LOWER-REDESIGN.md.

**INFRA RESTORED (was local-only in the prior session — never committed; confirmed via `git log -S`):**
- 3 public role-entry shims added to lower2.c: `lower2_value_entry`/`_pattern_entry`/`_goal_entry` (the only
  external surface — `lower2()` stays static; each seeds the cursor with a role and funnels in).
- `prove_lower2.c` rewritten: proves Fig-1 `5 > ((1 to 2)*(3 to 4))` (=9 real IR nodes) AND nested
  `(1 to 2) to (3 to 4)` (=7; `to-child.fail → from-child`), each with a PASS/FAIL node-count assertion + a
  full α/β/γ/ω port dump. Builders lit/bin/un/tri; kname covers all wired kinds.
- `scripts/prove_lower2.sh` — committed reproducible gate (compiles lower2.c+scrip_ir.c+prove_lower2.c
  standalone; the production lower.c is NOT linked, via local kind_is_resumable+cset_try_fold). **9/9 PASS.**

**Method.** Each box transcribes the canonical port equations (Proebsting §4 + `ir_a_*` + the §318 table) into
lower2's idiom (lcx_t cursor + `lower2()` recursion + nalloc/set_succ_fail/ret), in PURE four-port form (α/β
synthesized out, γ/ω inherited in) matching the foundation. lower.c's lower_new_*_ag are the exec-compat
reference. Value-plumbing (which node reads which operand `.value`) is DEFERRED to LOWER2-EXEC (IR_t lacks the
`c[]` child array the design §204 imagined; operands collapsed onto α/β — verify against the executor, do not
assume). The proof checks TOPOLOGY only.

**TREE-PATTERN NOTES (read, acknowledged):** `tmatch_proto.c` `tm`/`tm_g` is a STEP-5 *refactor* of already-proven
box code into uniform MATCH-shape + CAPTURE-children + RECURSE + WIRE. MEASURED shallow (120 peeks, 12 two-level,
0 three-level; 78 uniform recursion calls); ~30% LOC shrink; win = uniformity. "Refactor proven code into pattern
form — don't design two things at once." Correctly deferred until all role arms are implemented + proven. Endgame:
(a) parse=LALR tokens→tree is SYMMETRIC to tmatch tree→IR; (b) IR_PAT_DEFER = runtime analog of a compile-time
capture; (c) the pattern-form C transliterates to the Icon-bootstrap lowerer.

### Rung ladder (VALUE role unless noted) — proven box-by-box via scripts/prove_lower2.sh

- [x] **L2-A — combinators**: conjunction `TT_SEQ`/`TT_SEQ_EXPR` (= binop w/o compute; `ir_conjunction` —
  `c0.γ→c1.α`, `c0.ω→ω`, `c1.γ→conj`, `c1.ω→c0.β`, resume=c1.β), alternation `TT_ALTERNATE` (2nd runtime-gated
  box; `ir_a_Alt` — `arm.γ→alt`, fail-chain `arm[i].ω→arm[i+1].α`, last→ω, resume=alt, arm resumes in operand_aux).
- [x] **L2-B-core — loops**: `TT_EVERY` (`ir_a_Every`: E1.γ→body.α, body.γ=body.ω=E1.β, E1.ω→every.fail; no-body

  **`TT_ARBNO` ✅**, **CAT chain (`TT_SEQ`/`TT_CAT`) ✅**, **ALT (`TT_ALT`) ✅**, **captures `TT_CAPT_COND_ASGN`/`_IMMED_ASGN`/`_CURSOR` ✅**,
  **`TT_DEFER`(*var) + bare `TT_VAR` ✅**, **`TT_BAL` ✅** (2026-05-31 — IR_PAT_BAL generator, proven). **`TT_FNC` pattern-primitive folds: N/A ✅** — INVESTIGATED 2026-05-31 (Sonnet 4.6): the SNOBOL4 parser NEVER delivers SPAN/ANY/LEN/etc. as a generic `TT_FNC`. In `snobol4.y` the `T_FUNCTION` production calls `pat_prim_kind(name)`, and `tal_fnc_close` builds `ast_node_new(k==TT_VAR ? TT_FNC : k)` — so a recognized primitive name (ANY/NOTANY/SPAN/BREAK/BREAKX/LEN/POS/RPOS/TAB/RTAB/ARB/ARBNO/REM/FAIL/SUCCEED/FENCE/ABORT/BAL) is constructed DIRECTLY as its dedicated `TT_*` kind (all already handled in `lower_pattern`); only a non-primitive name becomes `TT_FNC`. A `TT_FNC` reaching `lower_pattern` is therefore a user function returning a pattern value used in pattern position — runtime-resolved (DEFER territory), NOT a compile-time primitive fold — and correctly falls to `lower_unhandled` (loud). **L2-P lowering is COMPLETE; no fold arm needed.**
  (foundation leaves LIT/ARB/REM/SPAN/ANY/NOTANY/BREAK/BREAKX already in lower_pattern via pat_cset_arg.)
  CAT/ALT done 2026-05-31 via SHARED `wire_seq`/`wire_alt`. **Leaves added 2026-05-31 (this handoff):** LEN→IR_PAT_LEN,
  POS/RPOS→IR_PAT_POS (RPOS sval="r"/dval=1.0; bounded, β=ω_in), TAB/RTAB→IR_PAT_TAB (generator, self-β), FENCE→IR_PAT_FENCE
  (bounded; FENCE(inner) lowers inner then FENCE-successor), ABORT→IR_PAT_ABORT, FAIL→IR_FAIL, SUCCEED→IR_SUCCEED,
  ARBNO→IR_PAT_ARBNO (inner pattern in own IR_alloc sub-graph + bb_arbno_state_t), CAPT_COND/IMMED→IR_PAT_ASSIGN_COND/_IMM
  (inner.γ→capture, varname in sval), CAPT_CURSOR→IR_PAT_ATP, DEFER→IR_PAT_DEFER(ival=1), bare VAR→IR_PAT_DEFER(ival=0).
  `kind_is_resumable` extended with the pattern generators (β=self) so emit_leaf wires self-retry for generators and β=ω_in
  for POS/RPOS/FENCE/ABORT. Flag/payload encodings match the bb_exec.c oracle arms exactly. **NOT YET PROVEN — no prove_lower2.c
  cases for these arms yet (the 17/17 covers only the pre-existing arms). NEXT: add SNOBOL4 dump_pat cases (node counts + α/β/γ/ω).**
- [~] **L2-Goal — GOAL role**: **`TT_UNIFY` (+`=/2`) ✅**, **arith-compares (`< > =< >= =:= =\=`) ✅**, `TT_IF`, `TT_VAR`/`TT_FNC`
  call/builtin, **conj `,` ✅ / disj `;` ✅** /ITE (cut/true/fail leaves already in lower_goal).
  conj/disj done 2026-05-31 via SHARED `wire_seq`/`wire_alt` (IR_GCONJ/IR_DISJ); unify=`g_unify` (IR_UNIFY),
  compares=`g_compare` (IR_ARITH, ival=BinopKind). Remaining: ITE (`->`/`*->`), `is/2`, user-pred Call, `nl`,
  term-comparison (`==`/`@<`…), findall/catch. (Prolog EXEC stays resolve-runtime + sm_interp_run per RULES;
  these arms are topology-only, proven via prove_lower2.sh, feeding the eventual goal graph.)
- [~] **LOWER2-EXEC** — **SNOBOL4 pattern-match statements EXECUTE ✅ (2026-05-31 Opus 4.8, the long pole — first since SMX-4):**
  `v_scan` lowers `SUBJECT ? PATTERN` (+ `= REPLACEMENT`) to `IR_SCAN`; the `IR_SCAN` exec arm drives the pattern
  sub-graph through the 19-arm `IR_PAT_*` oracle with anchored start-iteration + deferred-capture flush + replacement
  splice; `bb_reset` preserves `IR_SCAN.counter`; walker does match-replace synthesis + default fall-through; bare
  ARB/REM/BAL/FAIL/SUCCEED/FENCE/ABORT recognized. 13/13 byte-identical to SPITBOL oracle. (See Watermark.) **STILL OPEN:**
  Icon value-level proof — wire `lower2_value_entry` → bb_exec on `1 to 5`; confirm/adjust the relational flag (`dval=1.0`)
  + if-gate (`node.β` runtime dispatch) + alt-gate (operand_aux) AGAINST the executor.
- [ ] **L2-TMATCH** — STEP 5: refactor the proven box code into `tm`/`tm_g` pattern form (match-capture-recurse-wire);
  retire `tmatch_proto.c`'s `#if 0` exhibit. Don't start until the arms above are proven.
- [ ] **LM-6 DISPATCH-UNIFY** — once all roles armed + exec-proven, retire lower.c's 3 dispatch entry points; lower2 IS the lowerer.

**HANDOFF (2026-06-02, Opus 4.8) — `bb_bin_t` ABOLISHED + MEDIUM-INVISIBLE PRISON; SCRIP BUILDS GREEN + ABORTS
BEAUTIFULLY (≈63 bomb stubs).** Lon directive: "get the build broke nice, build the prison of rules, leave it to
the Four Musketeers to fix up on their particular test; ensure SCRIP builds and aborts in 100s of places
beautifully." Done: (1) **Deleted `bb_bin_t` + `bb_emit_asm_result`/`_pairs`** from `emit_str.h`/`.cpp` — the
`bin.sites.push_back((int)b.size())` function-byte-counter idiom no longer compiles. (2) **TWO new FACT RULES**
folded byte-identical-×4 into all GOAL-*-BB files (this block at the top: `bb_bin_t` IS ABOLISHED + ONE MEDIUM,
INVISIBLE) — md5 `17049e7a`; also staged in `GOAL-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-RULES-DRAFT.md`. They are THREE FACES (with the
no-`pBB`/`_.node` rule) of one converted box = pure `x86()` concat reading only `_`; the three gates reach zero
together. (3) **63 un-converted boxes → LOUD `x86_bomb()` stubs** + 9 empty router sub-TUs (binop/seq arms); each
prints `libscrip_rt: BOMB — <box>: TEMPLATE-REVAMP not yet converted` then `Aborted`. (4) **`scrip` + `libscrip_rt`
BUILD GREEN**; mode-2 ORACLE HARD-held (SNOBOL4 **7/7**, Icon **12/12**); modes 3/4 now bomb per-box (SNOBOL m3
5→0, Icon m3 12→0) — restored as each lane converts. (5) New `x86_asm.h`: **`x86_and`** (byte-verified `and rsp,-16`
= `48 83 E4 F0`) + **`x86_bomb`** (canonical stub, RO-encoders + ud2, medium-invisible). (6) Fixed the pasted
`bb_pat_defer` medium-branch (alignment dance now via `x86()`); converted SNOBOL `bb_pat_cat`/`bb_pat_alt` →
`x86_pair_loop()` (pBB-free, dispatch parameterless) + `xa_flat.cpp` off `bb_bin_t` (local one-site `xa_emit_one`,
exact bytes, driver-label semantics). (7) New gates `scripts/test_gate_no_bb_bin_t.sh` (HARD, **0** live refs) +
`scripts/test_gate_template_medium_invisible.sh` (informational; **1** left = `bb_unop`, Icon's box) wired into the
gate suite. `g_vstack` 0 · prove_lower2 **67** · concurrency invariants OK (FACT RULES byte-identical) ·
template-purity now GREEN (bomb stubs removed the side-effecting calls). **THE FOUR MUSKETEERS:** convert your
lane's `x86_bomb` stubs to real `x86()` as your test reaches them (8 SNOBOL + 8 Prolog + 8 Raku + ~39 Icon/shared;
`git show HEAD~1:<path>` has each box's original byte logic). Full manifest:
`HANDOFF-2026-06-02-OPUS48-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-BB-BIN-T-ABOLISHED.md`. **NOTE — NOT pushed: this break spans all four

**HANDOFF (2026-06-02, Opus 4.8) — SNOBOL4 loop-free pattern leaves COMPLETE; combinators unblocked via landed
`x86_pair_loop()`.** This session landed `bb_pat_fence` + `bb_pat_break` (`c66bbc8`, pushed), completing the
loop-free SNOBOL4 pattern-leaf conversion to `x86()` self-encoding. After the parallel Prolog session landed the
shared `x86_pair_loop()` combinator primitive (`acea982`, touches the shared `x86_asm.h`), I synced + rebuilt +
RE-GATED: SNOBOL4 m2 **7/7 HARD** / m3 5/6 / m4 0/6, BREAK/BREAKX + FENCE functionally correct (m3==m2==oracle),

edit needed (Prolog already landed the primitive; SNOBOL reads the same `g_emit.xa_bb_emit_pair_*` fields). Then
the REG ladder REG-RO rung (RO addresses → `[rip+disp]`) to retire r10 and lift SNOBOL m4 off 0/6. ⚠ COORDINATION
NOTE: 5 concurrent pushes across this session's turns (Icon `bb_unop`/`bb_succeed`, Prolog `x86_pair_loop`) — all
rebased clean (everyone edits own boxes), but the SHARED `GOAL-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-RULES-DRAFT.md` + `x86_asm.h` are
genuine contention points (Prolog and I designed the pair-loop primitive simultaneously; theirs landed first and is
superior — index-carrying `'E'`/`'F'` records vs my draft `'P'`/`'Q'` pointer records, which I discarded).

**This session (2026-06-02, Opus 4.8 cont.) — TEMPLATE-REVAMP: `bb_pat_fence` + `bb_pat_break` converted to x86() self-encoding (pBB-free); the LOOP-FREE pattern leaves are now ALL DONE:**
- **`bb_pat_fence`** — LOOP-FREE single-shot convert (the bare-FENCE primitive, no argument). Per the mode-2 oracle
  (bb_exec.c IR_PAT_FENCE) + SPITBOL Manual ch.18 ("matches the null string and succeeds when the scanner is moving
  left to right, but fails if the scanner has to back up through it"): α saves δ to a ζ-frame slot then `jmp γ` (null
  match, always succeeds forward); β restores δ from the slot then `jmp ω` (the fence effect — backtrack fails). One
  ζ-frame dword saved_δ @ `[r12+off]` via `bb_slot_claim(4)`, register-relative so BINARY==TEXT (no movabs, no
  rip-rel .data). Ratified cursor δ=R14d (REG-3). pBB-free end-to-end (fn/wrapper/prototype/dispatch all `void`).
  No internal labels needed (single-shot, like POS/TAB). Verified: a pattern hitting FENCE on the forward pass
  succeeds and matches null (`'a' FENCE 'b'` in `'abc'` → ok). NOTE: the two SPITBOL backtrack-blocking examples
  (`ANY('AB') FENCE '+'` in `'1AB+'` → fail; `FENCE 'B'` as first component → anchored-fail) fail in BOTH m2 AND m3
  (agreement) — a PRE-EXISTING mode-2 oracle gap in FENCE-through-ALT/ANY backtracking, NOT a regression from this
  conversion (the box agrees with the oracle exactly; the oracle itself doesn't propagate the fence into those
  ALT/capture-resume contexts — that is the same 124/114 DEFER-capture-resume blocker tracked elsewhere in this file).
- **`bb_pat_break`** — LOOPING convert (BREAK + BREAKX, both arms in one pass). BREAK(S) scans from δ to the first
  char in set S (NOT included), fails if the subject ends first; BREAKX(S) on backtrack "looks past" — steps past the
  break char and rescans to the NEXT char in S (SPITBOL Manual ch.3 word4.spt; INTEGERS ? BREAKX('E') . OUT 'ER' →
  INTEG). Grounded in the mode-2 oracle (bb_exec.c IR_PAT_BREAK: α scan-to-first; β plain = δ−=z+fail; β BREAKX =
  origin=δ−z, rescan from origin+z to next, fail if none/i<=z else δ=origin+z). The match-state scalars moved OFF the
  process-global `rt_cs_t` (`bb_cs_zeta` + `movabs &zeta`) INTO the ζ-frame: z @ `[r12+off]`, z_orig @ `[r12+off+4]`
  via `bb_slot_claim(8)`, register-relative so BINARY==TEXT (PER-BOX LOCAL STORAGE / NO-VALUE-STACK FACT RULES).
  Internal labels: plain BREAK loop=L(0)/done=L(1); BREAKX β-rescan adds loop2=L(2)/done2=L(3) — resolved by the
  bb_emit_x86 walker. strchr(cs,ch)≠NULL ⇒ char in set; r10 push/pop around the call (r13/r14/r15 callee-saved,
  survive). Ratified Σ=R13/δ=R14d/Δ=R15d (REG-2; was already register-migrated, this conversion drops the `bb_bin_t`
  hand-counted byte map + the process-global zeta scratch). pBB-free end-to-end. r10-as-cursor mirror was already
  gone (REG-2); the only r10 use left is the strchr push/pop guard. **Verified mode-3 == mode-2 == SPITBOL oracle**
  for plain BREAK (delimiter found, delimiter absent→fail, word-split), AND BREAKX look-past (INTEGERS→INTEG) — all
  4 cases byte-exact. The BREAKX β rescan loop + ζ z/z_orig + strchr-with-r10 all exercised together. TEXT arm
  structure hand-assembled via `as` (both plain + BREAKX β rescan) to confirm the internal-label + ζ-frame GAS is
  well-formed (SNOBOL4 mode-4 end-to-end still pends the LOWER four-port-statement-BB wiring, PB-RB-8 — not box-specific).
- **`b.size()` count: 121 → 118** (this conversion REMOVED bb_pat_break's 3 hand-counted-offset sites; the box now
  has ZERO `b.size()`, ZERO `bb_bin_t`, ZERO `TEMPLATE_ADDR`/`[r10]`-cursor/`movabs &zeta` in code — the 3 grep hits
  in the file are comment mentions of what was removed). Progress toward the FACT-RULE zero goal.
- **Gates ALL GREEN + INVARIANT:** make scrip rc=0, libscrip_rt rc=0, SNOBOL4 m2 **7/7 HARD** / m3 5/6 / m4 0/6,
  pat-rung-suite M2 **18/19** (same pre-existing `053_pat_alt_commit`), prove_lower2 **67/67**, concurrency invariants
  OK (FACT RULES byte-identical ×3 UNPERTURBED — `x86_asm.h` NOT touched this session, so it is byte-neutral to
  Icon/Prolog/Raku; Icon m2/m3/m4 all-PASS confirmed), `g_vstack` **0**, broad interp corpus held at 108/280 (the
  GATE-4 `inc/` corpus-snapshot gap noted in the prior watermark persists — orthogonal). Files touched: `bb_pat_fence.cpp`
  + `bb_pat_break.cpp` (boxes, both rewritten) + `bb_templates.h` (two prototypes → `void`) + `emit_core.c` (two
  dispatch calls → parameterless). No `x86_asm.h` edit — both boxes use the EXISTING encoders (the SPAN looping box
  already proved the internal-label + ζ-frame + strchr/r10 vocabulary; FENCE reuses the FR()/jmp/def forms).
- **NEXT (SNOBOL4):** the loop-free pattern leaves are now ALL converted. What remains is the VARIABLE-LENGTH
  combinators — `bb_pat_cat`, `bb_pat_alt`, `bb_match`, and the `FENCE(P)` with-children PAIR path. The shared
  define/jmp-pair idiom is now **RESOLVED + LANDED** by the parallel Prolog session (PL-RV-3, `80613ca7`):
  `x86_pair_loop()` in `x86_asm.h` emits the whole `g_emit.xa_bb_emit_pair_*` define/jmp loop via two index-carrying
  in-band records (`'E'` = define `xa_bb_emit_pair_define[idx]`; `'F'` = rel32-jmp to `xa_bb_emit_pair_jmp[idx]`),
  so no raw pointer rides the byte stream and TEXT is byte-identical to the hand-rolled loops. A combinator's x86
  arm emits ONLY label-defs + unconditional jmps over DRIVER-minted `bb_label_t*` (zero instruction encoding), so a
  converted box is just `return x86_pair_loop();` (plus any leading comment). **SO THE SNOBOL4 combinators are now
  a direct adopt of the EXISTING `x86_pair_loop()` — no new design, no shared `x86_asm.h` edit needed** (Prolog
  already landed it; SNOBOL reads the same `g_emit` fields). Convert `bb_pat_cat`/`bb_pat_alt`/`bb_match` + the
  `FENCE(P)` pair path to `x86_pair_loop()`, drop their `bb_bin_t`, make them pBB-free; gate as usual. (Or pivot to
  the REG-RO rung — RO addresses → `[rip+disp]` — to fully retire r10 and unblock SNOBOL m4, per 🔴 CURRENT PRIORITY.)

**This session (2026-06-02, Opus 4.8 cont.) — TEMPLATE-REVAMP: `bb_pat_arb` + `bb_pat_defer` converted to x86() self-encoding (pBB-free):**
- **`bb_pat_arb`** (`fe94061`) — generator convert. ζ-frame state z (matched len) @ `[r12+off]` + zo (origin δ) @
  `[r12+off+4]` via `bb_slot_claim(8)` (PER-BOX LOCAL STORAGE / NO-VALUE-STACK FACT RULES) — the old process-global
  `std::deque<int>` z/zo + `movabs &z`/`&zo`/`&Σlen` bakes are GONE. Ratified registers Σ=R13/δ=R14d/Δ=R15d.
  Two-entry generator, NO internal loop label (like POS): α sets z=0, zo=δ, → γ (offers the 0-char match first per
  SPITBOL ch.18 "shortest possible substring … behaves like a spring"); β does z++, eax=zo+z, `cmp eax,r15d`/`jg ω`,
  δ=zo+z, → γ (expands one char per retry). Driven correctly by the existing `add reg,[r12+off]` / `mov [r12+off],imm`
  encoders — no new x86_asm.h vocabulary needed.
- **`bb_pat_defer`** (`fe94061`) — runtime-resolved pattern-valued variable. Migrated off the legacy `[r10]` cursor to
  δ=R14d (REG-3); pBB-free (varname=`_.op_sval`, flag=`_.op_ival`). α: rdi=&varname (RO via `x86_load_ro` lea[rip]/
  movabs), esi=flag, edx=δ, call `rt_defer_match`; `test eax,eax`/`js ω` (return <0 = fail); δ=eax; → γ. β: → ω
  (single-attempt). The 16-byte-aligned call sequence is PRESERVED (sub-pattern path → exec_stmt → SSE stores need
  aligned rsp): `push r10; push rbx; mov rbx,rsp; and rsp,-16; call; mov rsp,rbx; pop rbx; pop r10` — the three raw
  qword-mov/and bytes (`48 89 e3` / `48 83 e4 f0` / `48 89 dc`) `as`+objdump-verified before writing. X86-only.
- **Verified:** m2 smoke **7/7 HARD** (unchanged), pat-rung-suite **M2 18/19** (same pre-existing 053_pat_alt_commit),
  **ARB+DEFER green in BOTH m2 AND m3-native** (`'O' ARB 'A'`→matched; `'O' ARB P` with P='NT'→matched both modes,
  exercising ARB spring-expansion + DEFER string-literal resolution + the aligned call). Concurrency invariants hold
  (FACT RULES byte-identical ×3 UNPERTURBED), `g_vstack` 0, purity baseline (my two files NOT in the side-effect list),
  net −54 lines. Files: `bb_pat_arb.cpp` + `bb_pat_defer.cpp` (boxes) + `bb_templates.h` + `emit_core.c` (parameterless
  decl/dispatch). Rebased clean over sibling Raku `RK-HY-1/2` (`bb_seq`/`bb_nfa` de-cram) — no conflict.
- **ENV NOTE for next session:** GATE-4 (`test_interp_broad_corpus_and_beauty.sh`) reports ~108/280 not the ~251
  Session-Setup figure, because the script's `INC=corpus/programs/snobol4/demo/inc` directory is ABSENT from the
  current corpus checkout (include-dependent tests fail in the harness though they pass run-directly — verified
  `097_keyword_alphabet` emits the exact ref). A corpus-snapshot/harness gap, NOT a regression and orthogonal to the
  conversion; restore that `inc/` dir (or repoint the script) to re-baseline GATE-4. Also: the clone token's last
  char before `5dK` is lowercase `h` (`…Sy0xh5dK`); an uppercase-`H` variant 401s — set the remote URL accordingly.
- **NEXT (SNOBOL4):** next loop-free leaf is `bb_pat_fence` (do the single-shot save-Δ-on-α / restore-on-β form
  first); then looping `bb_pat_break` (follow SPAN); then the STILL-OPEN variable-length define/jmp-pair combinators
  `bb_pat_cat`/`bb_pat_alt`/`bb_match` + FENCE's pair path (whoever reaches a combinator first designs that idiom once
  in `GOAL-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-RULES-DRAFT.md`).

**This session (2026-06-02, Opus 4.8 cont.) — TEMPLATE-REVAMP: `bb_pat_abort` + `bb_pat_tab` + `bb_pat_atp` converted; `x86_movimm32` encoder added:**
- **`bb_pat_atp`** (`52daa2e`) — LOOP-FREE single-shot convert. @var cursor capture: α writes δ to var via
  `rt_at_cursor` then → γ; β fails → ω. Cursor δ read from R14d (REG-3; legacy `[r10]` cell GONE). Varname is RO
  via `x86_load_ro` (lea[rip] TEXT / movabs BINARY), call via `x86_call_ro`, double `push/pop r10` around the
  side-effecting call (NV_SET print-path clobbers caller-saved r10 + rsp 16-align). varname = `_.op_sval` (==
  driver `op_name1` for IR_PAT_ATP). X86-only (no other arm). pBB-free; prototype + dispatch parameterless.
  **mode-3 == mode-2** verified: `LEN(3)@P`→P=3, `@Q LEN(2)@R`→Q=0/R=2, `BREAK(' ')@W` in "hello world"→W=5.
- **Full session detail + NEXT STEPS:** `HANDOFF-2026-06-02-OPUS48-SNOBOL4-BB-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-V4-ABORT-TAB-ATP.md`

  `bb_cut` (Prolog `ed42331`) + `bb_binop_arith` (Icon `b8db625`) — rebased clean, no conflict, rebuilt+reverified.
- **`bb_pat_abort`** (`66eb967`) — TRIVIAL convert: x86 arm = `x86("jmp",PORT_OMEGA)+x86("def",PORT_BETA)+x86("jmp",PORT_OMEGA)`.
  pBB-free (reads `_` only); prototype + dispatch parameterless. Verified mode-3: a pattern hitting ABORT fails the
  match (SPITBOL Manual ch.18: ABORT causes pattern match failure).
- **`bb_pat_tab`** (`66eb967`) — LOOP-FREE convert on the ratified registers δ=R14d / Δ=R15d (legacy `[r10]`/`lea[rip+Σlen]`
  GONE). TAB(N): `cmp r14d,N / jg ω / mov32 r14d,N / jmp γ / def β / jmp ω`. RTAB(N): `mov ecx,r15d / sub ecx,N /
  cmp r14d,ecx / jg ω / mov r14d,ecx / jmp γ / def β / jmp ω`. RTAB distinguished by `sval[0]=='r'` (NOT `ival!=0`).
  Semantics matched to mode-2 oracle (`bb_exec.c` IR_PAT_TAB): target = N (TAB) | Σlen−N (RTAB), fail if δ>target,
  advance δ=target, β fails restoring δ. **mode-3 == mode-2** verified for TAB(2), TAB(0), RTAB(2), RTAB(0), and the
  cursor-past-target failure path (`LEN(3) TAB(1)` / `LEN(3) RTAB(4)` both correctly fail).
- **NEW ENCODER `x86_movimm32`** in `x86_asm.h` (+ `"mov32"` front-end mnemonic) — 32-bit `mov reg,imm32` (B8+rd,
  REX.B when reg≥8; 5/6 bytes; `mov r14d,N`=`41 BE imm32`). Byte-verified vs `as` BEFORE use. ADDITIVE — no existing
  encoder perturbed (the 64-bit `x86_movimm`/movabs path for operand-constant loads is untouched). The `mov` vs `mov32`
  mnemonic split is the R7-sanctioned way to pick the immediate width at the call site.
- Gates ALL GREEN: m2 **7/7 HARD**, m3 5/6 (`define` lone fail), PAT-BB rung 18/19 m2 (`053_pat_alt_commit` pre-existing),
  g_vstack **0**, prove_lower2 PASS, concurrency invariants OK (FACT RULES byte-identical ×3), Icon smoke 2/2 (shared
  `x86_asm.h` edit caused no Icon regression). Detail: this watermark (no separate HANDOFF file this turn).
- **NEXT loop-free leaves:** `bb_pat_atp` / `bb_pat_arb` / `bb_pat_defer` (read each for its exact shape; arb/atp touch
  variable storage). Then looping `bb_pat_break` (follow SPAN), then the variable-length combinators.

**Prior session (2026-06-02, Opus 4.8) — TEMPLATE-REVAMP: x86() internal-label keystone + `bb_pat_pos` + `bb_pat_span` converted; mode-4 verbiage corrected:**
- **x86() SELF-ENCODING REVAMP** (per GOAL-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-RULES-DRAFT): each BB becomes ONE return per PLATFORM_*,
  pure `x86(mnem,…)` concatenation, NO `bb_bin_t`, pBB-free (reads `_` only). In-band records replace the hand-counted
  offset table — `L`(literal bytes) / `J`(rel32 patch to a label) / `D`(define a label); the consumer `bb_emit_x86`
  DISCOVERS byte positions as it copies, so no offset can drift.
- **KEYSTONE `a1779e6`** (looping-box prerequisite for ALL FOUR sessions, purely additive → zero regression):
  (1) INTERNAL (box-local) LABELS — record ids ≥ `X86_INTERNAL_BASE`(4) map in the walker to a fresh box-local
  `bb_label_t`; forward+backward refs resolved by the EXISTING `bb_label_define`/`bb_emit_patch_rel32` patch list;
  TEXT names `.Lx<uid>_<n>`, uid set per-box by `x86_begin()`; front-end `x86("jmp"/jcc/"def", L(n))`. (2) ζ-FRAME
  `[r12+off]` MEM OPS (mov-imm/store/load/add-imm/add-to-reg) — register-relative so BINARY==TEXT bytes (PER-BOX
  LOCAL STORAGE / NO-VALUE-STACK FACT RULES; no `movabs` to a process addr, no rip-rel `.data`); front-end via
  `FR(off)`. (3) `cmp r32,imm` (imm8/imm32/eax). (4) `bb_slot_claim(bytes)` — node-free per-sequence frame claim so a
  pBB-free box takes private scratch without an `IR_t*` key. Every encoder byte-verified vs `as`.
- **`bb_pat_pos` `195bea4`** — POS/RPOS → x86() + ratified regs (REG-3); the LOOP-FREE register-migration reference.
  POS `cmp r14d,N`; RPOS `mov ecx,r15d / sub ecx,N / cmp r14d,ecx`; then `jne ω / jmp γ / def β / jmp ω`. Legacy
  `[r10]`/`&Σlen` GONE; cursor δ=R14d, length Δ=R15d read straight from the regs. RPOS distinguished by `sval[0]=='r'`
  (authoritative per lower_pat_dcg.c), NOT `ival!=0`. Verified mode-3: POS(0)'abc'=Xde, POS(2)'c'=abXde,
  'cde'RPOS(0)=abX, 'b'POS(0) correctly fails.
- **`bb_pat_span` `3769d21` (+ encoders `24b9c78`)** — FIRST LOOPING box on x86(); validates the keystone end-to-end
  and is the reference looping-box conversion for all sessions. Internal labels loop=`L(0)`/done=`L(1)`; the match-state
  scalars z (matched length) and zo (β-undo origin) moved from the process-global deque (`movabs` to a fixed addr) to
  ζ-frame z@`[r12+off]`/zo@`[r12+off+4]` via `bb_slot_claim(16)` → BINARY==TEXT, re-entrant; cset/strchr reuse the
  any-style RO load. New encoders (byte-verified vs `as`): `jle`(0F 8E), `add reg,reg`(01/r), `add reg,[r12+off]`(03/r).
  Verified mode-3: SPAN('a')/'aaabbb'=Xbbb, SPAN('ab')=X, SPAN('xyz')/'xyz123'=Q123, SPAN('a')/'bbb' fails, AND
  SPAN('a')'ab'/'aaab'=X (β GIVE-BACK — exercises the internal labels + ζ-scratch + β port together).
  ⚠ encoders for span were left unstaged in 3769d21 and added in 24b9c78 — the remote TIP 24b9c78 builds; 3769d21 alone does not.
- **MODE-4 VERBIAGE CORRECTED (Lon directive):** mode-4 is NOT "aborting by design" and is NOT inferior to mode-3 — the
  two are the SAME boxes in two media (BINARY run in-process vs TEXT relocatable), and for the ζ-frame/REG-ratified
  boxes the bytes are identical. SNOBOL4 mode-4 is pending ONE wiring step (LOWER emitting the four-port statement-BB
  graph directly; the emission scaffolding is intact, and Icon/Prolog mode-4 already emit). Corrected `scrip.c`'s
  comment + abort message, and the stale historical note that claimed BOTH modes abort by design (mode-3 never aborted
  after the `sno_flat_chain_build` re-wire). `eval_code.c`'s "by design" abort is a DIFFERENT, correct one (the removed
  global value stack) — left as-is.
- Files: `emit_globals.h` + `emit_bb.c` + `x86_asm.h` (keystone/encoders); `bb_pat_pos.cpp` + `bb_pat_span.cpp` +
  `bb_templates.h` + `emit_core.c` (boxes); `src/driver/scrip.c` (verbiage).
- Gates GREEN throughout: SNOBOL4 m2 **7/7 HARD** / m3 5/6 (floor 5) / m4 0/6 (floor 0 — a MEASURED state pending the
  LOWER wiring, **not** a design abort), PAT-BB probes 3/3, prove_lower2 PASS, `g_vstack`==0. **Reference examples are now
  ample:** POS (loop-free reg-migration) + SPAN (looping: internal labels + ζ-scratch + β give-back) + the five pBB-free
  exemplars (rem/len/any/notany/lit) cover every remaining box's shape.
- **NEXT (SNOBOL4 x86() conversion remainder), in order:** loop-free legacy→REG-ratified+x86(): `bb_pat_tab`
  (TAB `cmp r14d,N / jg ω / mov r14d,N` — needs a `mov r32,imm32` encoder, 41 BF imm32; RTAB via Δ=r15d
  `mov ecx,r15d/sub/cmp/jg/mov r14d,ecx`), `bb_pat_atp`, `bb_pat_arb`, `bb_pat_defer`, `bb_pat_abort` (TRIVIAL:
  `jmp ω / def β / jmp ω`). LOOPING: `bb_pat_break` (follow the SPAN pattern; plain BREAK ≈ SPAN, BREAKX two-loop needs
  L(0..3) and z/z_orig moved from `[zeta+8/+12]` to ζ-frame). VARIABLE-LENGTH (separate define/jmp-pair design, shared
  with Icon/Prolog `xa_bb_emit_pair_*`): `bb_pat_fence` (pair-array path), `bb_pat_cat`, `bb_pat_alt`, `bb_match`.
- **OTHER SESSIONS CLEARED TO START** (`.github` `97355e35`): updated the SHARED `GOAL-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-RULES-DRAFT.md`
  so Icon/Prolog/Raku don't rebuild the keystone (it's in the shared `x86_asm.h` → would collide). Flipped its
  "OPEN DESIGN ITEM — INTERNAL LABELS" to **RESOLVED (LANDED `30e8422`)** with the live API (`x86_begin`/`L(n)`/
  `FR(off)`/`bb_slot_claim`), added a **START HERE** header (rebase onto `30e8422`; reference boxes `bb_pat_pos`
  loop-free + `bb_pat_span` looping; recipe in HANDOFF V3), and refreshed the `x86_asm.h` vocabulary list. The
  ONE remaining shared unknown is the VARIABLE-LENGTH define/jmp-pair loop (combinators + FENCE pair path + likely
  Raku `bb_nfa`) — flagged "STILL OPEN," to be designed once by whoever reaches a combinator first. Did NOT edit
  the other sessions' GOAL files (their own to touch). [SUPERSEDED by the next bullet — Lon directed top-of-file RUNG.]
- **RUNG NOW AT TOP OF EVERY GOAL FILE** (`.github` `09e07507`, Lon directive): a session reads its own
  `GOAL-{LANG}-BB.md` top-down, so the revamp priority was being missed (it lived only in the RULES-DRAFT + the
  bottom watermark — never "first"). Added a concise **"CURRENT PRIORITY — READ FIRST"** block right after the title
  in SNOBOL4/Icon/Prolog/Raku: the x86() goal, keystone **LANDED `30e8422` (REBASE FIRST)**, START HERE → RULES-DRAFT,
  reference boxes `bb_pat_pos`(loop-free)/`bb_pat_span`(looping), recipe HANDOFF V3, the STILL-OPEN combinator idiom,
  and each file's box list. Inserted ABOVE the byte-identical NO-C-BYRD-BOX FACT RULE (its md5 unchanged across all 5
  files, so that gate stays green); a top-of-file insertion is a different hunk from the bottom watermark, so live
  sessions (Icon on `bb_binop_arith` — a loop-free leaf that needs no keystone) rebase clean. Snocone omitted (not in
  the four-session divvy-up).

**Prior session (2026-06-01, Opus 4.8) — REG-2 COMPLETE (6/6): `bb_pat_break` (BREAK + BREAKX) migrated:**
- **REG-2 6/6** — finished by converting the last cursor-advancing leaf, `bb_pat_break`, off the legacy
  `[r10]`-cursor + `&Σ`/`&Σlen` movabs bakes to Σ=R13/δ=R14d/Δ=R15d. **Both arms in one pass** (all-or-nothing for
  the REG-FENCE grep): plain BREAK **153B, sites {125,129,149}** (internal Δ jge +63 / jnz +19 / jmp loop −88);
  BREAKX **290B, sites {125,130,134,265,286}** (α scan to first cset char + β rescan to next; identical per-loop
  internal jumps jge +87 / jnz +19 / jmp loop −88). `z` lives in `[zeta+8]`; BREAKX `z_orig` lives in `[zeta+12]`
  (the 4B padding of the 16B `rt_cs_t`), recovered as δ−z BEFORE the z++ at β entry. r11 + push/pop r11 dropped
  (Σ=r13 used directly in `movzx esi,[r13+rcx+0]` — the disp8 SIB form, 6B); only push/pop r10 around `strchr`
  remains. BINARY+TEXT both converted; both arms assembled via the `as`-transcribe route, objdump-verified, then
  Python byte-recounted to confirm every site and every internal-jump literal. Token-clean: zero
  `TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIG*`/`[r10]` in code OR comment. Zero `b.size()` introduced (stash-verified: 123 with AND without
  the diff — the +1 over the 122 watermark is the intervening Prolog tree, not this change).
- Single file touched: `src/emitter/BB_templates/bb_pat_break.cpp` (+155/−144).
- Gates all GREEN + invariant; m2 7/7 HARD held; no regression. **REG-2 is done → next is REG-RO** (then REG-3…5,
  REG-FENCE). REG-FENCE can now re-check SNOBOL m4 once a full pattern chain assembles+links (the `&Σ`/`&Σlen`
  bakes are gone from the cursor-advancing family; r10 traffic + RO `movabs` addresses are what REG-RO finishes).

**Prior session (2026-06-01, Opus 4.8) — REG-2 (5/6) cursor leaves + REG-RO step added:**
- **REG-2 5/6** (SCRIP `eb4bf7c`): migrated `bb_pat_len`/`rem`/`any`/`notany`/`span` off the `[r10]`-cursor +
  `&Σ`/`&Σlen` bakes to Σ=R13/δ=R14/Δ=R15. BINARY+TEXT both; span also dropped r11 + its push/pop (Σ=r13 used
  directly in the indexed byte load). Every BINARY byte map disasm-verified with `as`+`objdump` BEFORE writing
  (caught a real `movzx [r13+rcx]` SIB-encoding bug — r13 base needs the disp8 form, 6 bytes not 5); all 5
  token-clean. Per-box β semantics preserved. Per-box sizes/sites in the REG-2 rung above.
- **NEW STEP REG-RO** (REG ladder, inserted before REG-FENCE): READ-ONLY locals → IP-relative. The SNOBOL pattern
  BINARY arms bake RO ADDRESSES (lit / cset / `memcmp` / `strchr`) as `movabs` imm64, violating the RULES.md
  **ICON READ-ONLY LOCALS ARE IP-RELATIVE FACT RULE**; move each to `[rip+disp]` into a sealed RO trailer (the
  TEXT arms already do this). Makes the BINARY arm position-independent (a 2nd m4 lever) and — together with the
  RW register ladder — eliminates r10 entirely (the `[r10]` mirror writes + `push/pop r10` guards become dead).
  (Lon directive.)

**Prior session (2026-06-01, Opus 4.8) — FACT RULE + REG-0/1 + bb_match literal conversion:**
- **NEW FACT RULE "TWO LITERAL FORMS ONLY"** (above, after the NO-VALUE-STACK rule) — byte-identical ×5 GOAL-*-BB
  (block md5 `67020897`). The two literal forms (MEDIUM_BINARY = hand-coded byte map with HARDCODED literal offsets;
  MEDIUM_TEXT = literal asm) are CORRECT; the ONLY bad site is a FUNCTION that counts bytes (`b.size()`). `bytes()`,
  hardcoded `bin={{..}}`, literal rel32 deltas, `u32le/u64le`, `TEMPLATE_ADDR_*` are explicitly NOT bad.
- **NEW GUARD** `scripts/test_gate_no_handencoded_bytes.sh` — counts `b.size()` per `BB_templates/*.cpp` (comments
  stripped). Baseline **121 across 23 files** (informational; `--strict` = hard zero-check).
- **REG-0** (bb_match α establishes Σ=R13/Δ=R15/δ=R14 from SUBJECT ζ-slot; legacy `&Σ`/`&Σlen`/[r10] cells kept) +
  **REG-1** (bb_lit cursor→r14d / Σ→r13 / Δ→r15d; `&Σ`/`&Σlen` bakes removed; [r10] kept as mirror) — both LITERAL
  byte maps. **bb_match converted off `b.size()` → literal offset map** {87,91,121,141,150,151}, internal back-jump
  literal −78 (a genuine bad-site fix). PAT-BB probe **3/3** validates the offsets.
- (Mid-session a WRONG pivot abort-stubbed bb_lit/bb_match on a backward reading — REVERSED after Lon clarified.
  Net committed state is clean: literal byte maps, probe-green.)
**SNOBOL4 status:** mode-2 **7/7 HARD**, mode-3 5/6 (`define`/user-fn the lone fail — needs DEFINE registration +
a SNOBOL4 call frame + RETURN), mode-4 0/6 (pattern boxes bake `&Σ`/`&Σlen` imm64 → not relocatable; the REG
ladder removes that). prove_lower2 **67**, PAT-BB probes **3/3**, Icon m2 12/12 / m3 12/12 / m4 12/12, sm_dead 0,
concurrency OK (FACT RULES byte-identical-×3), purity 7 (MEDIUM_BINARY-exempt), g_vstack 0. FACT-RULE md5s the
audit pins: LOWER `5097ed94`, EMITTER `307534d6` (do not perturb the byte-identical-×3 blocks). ENV NOTE: the
build needs `libgc-dev` (`apt-get install -y libgc-dev`) — `core.h`/`raku_nfa_bb.c` include `<gc/gc.h>`.

**🔶 TEMPLATE-REVAMP v1 (PIVOT — Lon directive, 2026-06-01, SCRIP `2111555`).** Kill the two-divergent-arm +
hand-counted-`bb_bin_t` churn. New header-only `src/emitter/BB_templates/x86_asm.h`: self-encoding `x86_*`
helpers that switch BINARY/TEXT on `g_medium` (invisible in the template) + in-band patch records (L/J/D)
walked by `bb_emit_x86` (positions DISCOVERED, no offset table). Template API is ONE
`x86(mnem, ...)` keyed on the mnemonic (1st arg; trailing args' cardinality/type select the form via overloading;
the typed encoders are the internal impl) — Lon eureka 2026-06-01. `bb_lit` converted → ONE return, pure concat,
NO template locals, `MEDIUM_MACRO_DEF` dropped; BINARY arm byte-identical to `65686c2` (addr-masked). GO-FORWARD
(Lon): **TEXT-FIRST** — keep the GAS arm as source of truth, **throw away the hand-coded BINARY**, let `x86_*`
regenerate it position-independent (= REG-RO); **no safety net / no full regression** (four sessions fix typos),
move straight-forward, we are at GROUND ZERO. ⚠ This SUPERSEDES the TWO-LITERAL-FORMS / TEMPLATE-ONLY-EMISSION
FACT RULES — the rule text (5 GOAL files + RULES.md) + purity/concurrency gates need the coordinated rewrite to
land (grand-master-reorg). Detail + next steps: `HANDOFF-2026-06-01-OPUS48-SNOBOL4-BB-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-V1.md`.

**⭐ NEXT (SNOBOL4).** **(0) BB-LITERAL CLEANUP — drive the new GUARD's `b.size()` count to zero**
(`scripts/test_gate_no_handencoded_bytes.sh`, **121/23** baseline): rewrite each `b.size()` function-counter to a
hardcoded LITERAL offset map (the way bb_match was converted this session). ⚠ The in-scope handful is
`bb_pat_alt` + `bb_pat_cat`, but these are NOT a mechanical conversion: their `b.size()` sits inside a loop over
`g_emit.xa_bb_emit_pair_n` (a runtime-variable define/jmp pair count), so literal offsets need a DESIGN answer
(how a variable-length box gets literal patch offsets) — solve that before touching them. The other ~21 files are
Icon/Prolog/generic boxes (outside the SNOBOL goal). **(1) REG LADDER** (see the 🔴 CURRENT PRIORITY
section at the top): migrate the pattern BB templates off the legacy `[r10]`/`&Σ`/`&Σlen` model to the ratified
registers Σ=R13/δ=R14/Δ=R15/ζ=R12 — REG-0/REG-1 (bb_match α + bb_lit) landed, and **REG-2 is now COMPLETE 6/6**
(bb_pat_len/rem/any/notany/span SCRIP `eb4bf7c`; **bb_pat_break BREAK+BREAKX this session**). **Next is REG-RO**
(RO addresses → `[rip+disp]`, kills r10), then REG-3 (pos/tab) → REG-4 (combinators) → REG-5 (generators) →
REG-FENCE. **(2) THEN** PB-RB-4 (STITCH_SEQ/STITCH_ALT — topology already proven, only the emitter wiring + drive
remain; mode-3 `S ('a'|'b')` and `S 'a' 'b'`), PB-RB-5…OPT, and BROK-0…BROK-3. The pattern-engine breadth (PB-RB
ladder) is the LONG POLE for the SNOBOL4 corpus. Older per-session writeups live in the `HANDOFF-*.md` files.

**🔶 TEMPLATE-REVAMP v2 (continuation — 2026-06-01, Opus 4.8, SCRIP `d96e1b0`).** Four more boxes converted
to the `x86()` self-encoding form + `bb_lit` hardened: **`bb_pat_rem`, `bb_pat_len`, `bb_pat_any`,
`bb_pat_notany`, `bb_lit`** are now **`pBB`-free END-TO-END** (template fn / `extern "C" void bb_X(void)` /
`bb_templates.h` prototype / `emit_core.c` dispatch all parameterless) and **`_.node`-free** (grep proof: 0
of each in all five, code + comments). New op-promotion: `sm_emit_t.op_sval/op_ival` set at the single
dispatch point from `nd->sval/ival`; templates read `_.op_*`. `x86_asm.h` += 64-bit `test rax,rax`
(width-aware ALU), `x86_movzx_subj_byte` (indexed subject-byte load), and imm8 short-form for `x86_add`/`sub`
(BINARY now matches `as`). **NEW rules draft `.github/GOAL-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-RULES-DRAFT.md`** (R1–R13 normal +
the "reads only `_`, no `pBB`, no neighbor" **FACT RULE** — compiler-enforced via parameter removal + a
one-line `_.node` grep gate; reasons: no confusion + BB-fusion impossible). NOT yet folded into the 5 GOAL
files (that + the internal-label record design + `test_gate_template_no_node.sh` are the next session's
grand-master-reorg). Gates: m2 7/7 HARD · m3 5/6 · m4 0/6 · probes 3/3 · prove_lower2 67 · Icon m2 12/12 ·
concurrency OK (sm_emit_t field add did NOT perturb the byte-identical-×3 blocks) · purity clean · g_vstack 0.
Detail: `HANDOFF-2026-06-01-OPUS48-SNOBOL4-BB-TEMPLATE-REVAMP-V2-NO-PBB.md`. **OPEN (gates looping boxes):**
internal-label record kind for SPAN/BREAK/combinators/generators (L/J/D only encode the 4 ports today).
