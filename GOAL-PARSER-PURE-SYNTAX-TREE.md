# GOAL-PARSER-PURE-SYNTAX-TREE.md — Six Frontends, One Pure tree_t

**Repo:** one4all + .github
**Status:** Stage 1 active — SNOBOL4 Step 1 nearly done; Snocone Step 4 next
**Concurrent goals:** `GOAL-PST-ICN-RAKU.md` (Icon+Raku) · `GOAL-PST-REBUS-PROLOG.md` (Rebus+Prolog)

```
(source) ──► PARSER ──► (tree_t — pure syntax) ──► LOWER ──► IR_sm_t[]  ──┐
                                                                          ├──► interp / emitters
                                                            └─►  IR_bb_t  ──┘
```

Both forms are first-class IR. `IR_sm_t[]` is the linear stack-machine instruction array; `IR_bb_t` is the Byrd-box DCG for patterns and generators. `IR_sm_t` may reference `IR_bb_t*`; the reverse is never true. The earlier name `IR_t` becomes `IR_bb_t`; the earlier `SM_*` opcode prefix becomes `IR_SM_*`. See **Stage 2 — Lower** for the full rename map.

Parsers may only: discard pure layout tokens (parens, separators); choose a node kind for an operator. Everything else — rewrites, introduced nodes, labels, gotos, augop expansion, control-flow lowering, slot allocation — belongs in `lower`.

---

## Why

Three frontends carry historical deviation:
- **Snocone** — does ALL control-flow lowering in parser actions (labels, gotos, augop expansion, stmt splicing, loop frames). ~80 helper references in `snocone_parse.y`.
- **Rebus** — builds separate `RProgram`/`RStmt`/`RExpr` IR, never touches `tree_t`.
- **Prolog** — builds `Term*` + assigns variable slots during parsing. Zero `tree_t` references in `prolog_parse.c`.

Result: `lower` is asymmetric — for SNOBOL4 it does real lowering; for Snocone it gets pre-lowered input; for Rebus/Prolog there's a hidden conversion stage nobody owns.

---

## Pure-syntax rules

**Allowed in action bodies:** `ast_node_new(TT_*)`, `expr_new`, `expr_unary`, `expr_binary`, `ast_push`, `expr_add_child`. Setting `v.sval`/`v.ival`/`v.dval` from token. Flat-list growth (`ast_push` for left-recursive rules).

**Forbidden:** cloning subtrees; `sc_label_new`; splicing `STMT_t` chains; loop-frame tracking; building non-`tree_t` IR (`RExpr*`, `Term*`); variable-slot assignment; EXPORT/IMPORT string special-casing; resorting children for positional semantics.

Simplest rule: **if the action body reads or writes anything other than its own RHS values, it's doing something other than building the syntax tree.**

### ⛔ Left-to-right child order (added 2026-05-16, session 30/58)

**The children of every node must appear in the same left-to-right order in which their tokens are read from the source.** No reordering for "convenience," no swapping operand positions to match a runtime calling convention, no promoting a particular child to a distinguished slot because it's the "real" subject. The tree is a direct geometric record of the token stream's bracketed structure — nothing else.

Equivalent ways to say the same thing:

- A reduce `RHS_1 RHS_2 ... RHS_n → LHS` produces a node whose children are `[RHS_1, RHS_2, ..., RHS_n]` in exactly that order. (Empty/terminal RHS pieces that carry no AST value contribute nothing; everything else contributes in source order.)
- For any rule with a chained / left-recursive flavor (e.g. `expr → expr OP expr`), the AST kind reflects the operator, the children are `[left, right]`, and **the left child is whatever the parser had already built** — not flattened by reaching into the previous reduction. If a flat n-ary form is wanted (e.g. `TT_SEQ` for concatenation), produce it by **always making a fresh node**, never by mutating-in-place an existing sibling node from the stack.
- No reduction action may "look inside" a previously-built child and decide to attach to it instead of wrapping it. Example of what's now forbidden:
  ```
  goto_expr T_CONCAT goto_atom
      { if($1->t==TT_SEQ){expr_add_child($1,$3);$$=$1;}     /* FORBIDDEN: mutates prior node */
        else{tree_t*s=ast_node_new(TT_SEQ);expr_add_child(s,$1);expr_add_child(s,$3);$$=s;} }
  ```
  Must become:
  ```
  goto_expr T_CONCAT goto_atom
      { tree_t*s=ast_node_new(TT_SEQ);expr_add_child(s,$1);expr_add_child(s,$3);$$=s; }
  ```
  Yes, this builds a right-leaning chain of `TT_SEQ(prev, atom)` instead of a flat `TT_SEQ(a,b,c,d)`. **That is correct.** Re-flattening, if ever wanted, is a downstream concern (lower or a tree pass) — not a parser-action concern.

### Why this matters: the shift/reduce minimum

The reason this rule is binding is the Snocone-self-host endpoint. Once the C frontends produce a tree whose every node is `(kind, children-in-source-order)` with no positional surprises and no in-place mutation, **every frontend in `corpus/SCRIP/parser_*.sc` can be reduced to two operations**: `Shift` (push the next token's leaf node onto a working stack) and `Reduce(kind, n)` (pop `n` items from the stack, wrap them as the children of a new node of kind `kind`, push the node back). Nothing else. No "if the top-of-stack is already a SEQ then append," no "promote child 1 to the subject slot," no special-cases on TT_* kinds inside the reducer. The grammar table picks `kind` and `n`; `Shift` and `Reduce` execute mechanically.

This is the second half of the goal. The first half — making `tree_t` faithful to the grammar — is what every PST-* rung accomplishes. The second half — collapsing the parser-action surface to `{Shift, Reduce}` — only works if the first half holds the left-to-right invariant. A single in-place mutation in a single action breaks the equivalence.

Concrete consequence for every PST-* rung still ahead:
1. While reading a frontend's parse actions, flag any action that **inspects the kind or shape of an `$N` value** before deciding what to build. Those are the actions that have to be rewritten to "always wrap, never append-in-place."
2. While reading a frontend's parse actions, flag any action whose output node's children are not in `$1, $2, $3, ...` order (skipping syntactic-only RHS pieces). Those are reorderings and must be unwound.
3. After a rung is complete, the action body for every grammar rule should be expressible as **one** `Reduce(TT_KIND, N)` call (or zero, for purely-syntactic rules that pass a value through unchanged).

The PST-SN4-1b lesson (this session) is the canonical example: the parser's TT_SCAN-unpack and TT_SEQ-split were both `inspect-kind-and-rearrange` actions. Removing them and letting downstream consumers (via `stmt_split_subj_pat` helper) do the work at consumption time leaves the parser action as the pure form. The `goto_expr T_CONCAT goto_atom` example above is the next visible offender in `snobol4.y`; it's queued as part of PST-SN4-1d (or a new PST-SN4-1e if 1d turns out to be doc-only).

## Frontend status

| Frontend | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **SNOBOL4** | ~clean | Three warts in `sno4_stmt_commit_go`; goto fields on `STMT_t` not tree |
| **Icon** | clean | Targeted audit only |
| **Raku** | clean | Targeted audit only |
| **Snocone** | major rewrite | Entire control-flow lowering lives in parser |
| **Rebus** | full replacement | `RExpr`/`RStmt`/`RProgram` → `tree_t` |
| **Prolog** | full replacement + slot deferral | `Term*` → `tree_t`; slot assignment → lower |

---

## ⛔ Two-phase sequencing rule (supersedes old same-commit pairing — 2026-05-18)

**Phase 1 — C parsers only. Phase 2 — SCRIP mirrors only. Never both in the same session.**

The old "same-commit pairing" rule (Rule 1 below) is suspended for all remaining C-side PST rungs. Reason: writing Snocone (`parser_*.sc`) correctly requires deep SPITBOL pattern-matching knowledge that consumes too much context to combine with C work in the same session. Attempting both guarantees one or both is done badly.

### Phase 1 — C parsers clean (current phase)

Do only C work. No `corpus/SCRIP/parser_*.sc` changes. Each C rung may record a `⚠ MIRROR-GAP` in the State block — this is **expected and correct**, not a violation.

Phase 1 is complete when all six C parsers satisfy:
- Outputs only `tree_t` (no `Term*`, `RExpr*`, `RStmt*`, `RProgram*`)
- All children in left-to-right source token order
- No in-place child inspection or mutation in parser actions
- No synthetic labels, goto splicing, or control-flow lowering in the parser

Status per language:

| Language | Phase 1 complete? | Remaining C work |
|---|---|---|
| Icon | ✅ yes | — |
| SNOBOL4 | ✅ yes | — |
| Raku | ⏳ no | PRF-12: gather✅ sub, class, program, for-range → lower; PST-FIELD-1, PST-FIELD-2 |
| Snocone | ⏳ no | PST-SC-4k→4n: goto, split, TT_PROGRAM, ScParseState shrink |
| Rebus | ⏳ no | RB-C-1: stmt_list_ne always-wrap |
| Prolog | ⏳ no | PST-PL-6f: delete Term* paths |

**Cross-cutting Phase 1 rungs** (owned by `GOAL-PST-ICN-RAKU.md`):

- **PST-FIELD-1** — Remove `_nalloc` from `tree_t` struct (`src/include/ast.h`).
  `_nalloc` is allocator bookkeeping — not a semantic field. Switch `ast_push`
  to count-then-fill or hidden prefix. Update `ast_clone.c`.

- **PST-FIELD-2** — Remove `_id` from `tree_t` struct. Three uses to migrate:
  Raku `SUB_TAG_ID` → `TT_SUB_DECL` node kind (blocked on PRF-12-sub);
  Icon param count → `v.ival`; interpreter slot/env index → side table or `v.ival`.
  Full detail in `GOAL-PST-ICN-RAKU.md § PST-FIELD rungs`.

### Phase 2 — SCRIP mirrors (after all Phase 1 complete)

One dedicated session per `parser_*.sc`. Each session starts by learning SNOBOL4/Snocone from scratch — SPITBOL manual + PRIMER + `parser_snocone.sc` — before writing a line. The goal for each file: replace all tree-building functions with pure `shift`/`reduce` calls only.

SCRIP mirror map (for Phase 2 reference):

| C frontend | SCRIP mirror |
|---|---|
| `src/frontend/snobol4/snobol4.y` | `corpus/SCRIP/parser_snobol4.sc` |
| `src/frontend/icon/icon_parse.c` | `corpus/SCRIP/parser_icon.sc` |
| `src/frontend/raku/raku.y` | `corpus/SCRIP/parser_raku.sc` |
| `src/frontend/snocone/snocone_parse.y` | `corpus/SCRIP/parser_snocone.sc` |
| `src/frontend/rebus/*` | `corpus/SCRIP/parser_rebus.sc` |
| `src/frontend/prolog/prolog_parse.c` | `corpus/SCRIP/parser_prolog.sc` |
| `src/lower/lower.c` / `lower_*.c` | `corpus/SCRIP/lower.sc` |

### Retained mirror rules (apply in Phase 2 only)

2. **Per-step gate.** Every Phase 2 SCRIP rung: `parser_<lang>.sc` dump must match C `--dump-ast` for the smoke corpus. If they diverge, the rung is not done.
3. **Identifier mirroring.** Non-terminal names in `parser_<lang>.sc` mirror C parse-function names; IR node tags mirror exact strings the C dumper emits.
4. **Lower split-of-labor parity.** Whatever logic moved from parser to lower in Phase 1 must move identically in the SCRIP mirror during Phase 2.
5. **Byte-identical beauty test.** Beauty self-host via C frontend must remain md5 `abfd19a7a834484a96e824851caee159`. SCRIP frontend must eventually match.
6. **No silent mirror gap.** If a Phase 2 SCRIP change can't be completed, file `⚠ MIRROR-GAP-NNN` in State before committing anything partial.

**Shift/reduce endpoint.** When Phase 2 completes, each `corpus/SCRIP/parser_*.sc` is a dispatch table plus two primitives — `Shift(token)` and `Reduce(TT_KIND, n)` — with no per-rule action code. That is the proof of purity.

## Stage 1 — Parser step ladder

### Step 1 — SNOBOL4 cleanup

Owned by **`GOAL-PST-SNOBOL4.md`**. Work that step there.
Completed: PST-SN4-1a ✅ 1b ✅ 1c ✅ 1d ✅.
Remaining: PST-SN4-W1 (remove `->t==TT_QLIT` inspection from `sno4_stmt_commit_go`). Phase 2 SCRIP mirror: PST-SN4-SC-1, SC-2.

### Step 2 — Icon audit + Step 3 — Raku audit

Owned by **`GOAL-PST-ICN-RAKU.md`**. Work those steps there.
On completion, update Step 2 and Step 3 checkboxes in the Frontend status table above.

### Step 4 — Snocone rewrite (bulk of the work)

Add lower-side equivalent first, then strip parser-side desugaring. Each rung: gates green. **Phase 1 only — no SCRIP mirror changes during these rungs.** Record `⚠ MIRROR-GAP` in State for each rung completed without a SCRIP mirror; the mirror is addressed in Phase 2 as a dedicated session.

**⛔ SCRIP mirror session requirement for 4k–4n (Phase 2 only):** When writing `parser_snocone.sc` mirror changes, read `SNOBOL4-SNOCONE-PRIMER.md` in full first. Learn exact Snocone expression semantics and syntax from the SPITBOL manual (`pdftotext -layout spitbol-manual-v3_7.pdf /tmp/spitbol.txt`; use the nav map in `GOAL-PST-REBUS.md`). Learn exact Snocone statement and control-flow syntax from `corpus/SCRIP/parser_snocone.sc` itself. The endpoint for `parser_snocone.sc` is: every grammar production expressed as `shift`/`shift_val` leaf pushes plus one `reduce(TT_KIND, n)` call — no helper functions that build trees, no `Push`/`Pop`/`Append`/`Tree` inside function bodies. The counter discipline (`nPush`/`nInc`/`nTop`/`nPop`) in grammar rules for variable-arity reduces is permitted. Pure string preprocessors (no tree ops) are permitted.

- [x] **PST-SC-4a** ✅ (2026-05-16, one4all `3c09f91d`, corpus `67eaa51`) — Parser emits `TT_AUGOP(lhs, rhs)` with `v.ival = TK_AUG*`; `lower_augop` already handled it. `sc_clone_expr_simple` deleted. SCRIP mirror: `reduce_augmented` → `reduce_augop(op)`, `TK_AUGPOW=1007` added to `lower.sc` and `parser_snocone.sc`.

- [x] **PST-SC-4b** ✅ (2026-05-16, one4all `4aa8727b`, corpus `a939309`) — Parser emits `TT_IF(cond, TT_PROGRAM(then_stmts), TT_PROGRAM(else_stmts))` as a single `TT_STMT(:subj TT_IF(...))`. `IfHead`/`sc_if_head_new`/`sc_finalize_if_no_else`/`sc_finalize_if_else` deleted. `sc_collect_body()` extracts CODE_t stmt range into `TT_PROGRAM` subtree. `if_before_body` snapshot field added to `ScParseState`. ALT/SEQ always-wrap-binary fixes bundled (Snocone equivalent of PST-SN4-1d). `lower.c`: `case TT_PROGRAM` added to `lower_expr_inner`. SCRIP mirror: `finalize_if`/`finalize_if_else` rewritten; `lower_program_block` added to `lower.sc`.

- [x] **PST-SC-4c** ✅ (2026-05-16, one4all `e95a5c2e`, corpus `a8e957b`) — `TT_WHILE(cond, TT_PROGRAM(body), QLIT(cont), QLIT(end))`. `WhileHead`/`sc_while_head_new`/`sc_finalize_while` deleted. `while_before_body` snapshot. `lower_while_until` TT_PROGRAM-aware (break-safe, labtab_define). `lower_if_stmt` added. SCRIP mirror updated. Gates: 5/0, 8/0, 2/0.
- [x] **PST-SC-4d** ✅ (2026-05-16, one4all `0c51b493`, corpus `36d3d44`) — `TT_DO_WHILE(TT_PROGRAM(body), cond, QLIT(cont), QLIT(end))`. `DoHead`/`sc_do_head_new`/`sc_finalize_do_while` deleted. `do_before_body` snapshot. `lower_do_while` added. SCRIP mirror updated. Gates: 5/0, 8/0, 2/0.
- [x] **PST-SC-4e** ✅ (2026-05-16, one4all `c276b48c`, corpus `d4b3f6b`) — `TT_FOR(cond, step, TT_PROGRAM(body), QLIT(cont), QLIT(end))`. `ForHead` slimmed to `{cond,step}`. `for_before_body` snapshot. `lower_for` added. SCRIP mirror updated. Gates: 5/0, 8/0, 2/0.
- [x] **PST-SC-4f** ✅ (2026-05-16) — `TT_CASE(disc, val1, TT_PROGRAM(body1), ..., QLIT(end))`. `CaseEntry.before_body` snapshot added. `sc_switch_case_label`/`sc_switch_default_label` snapshot instead of emitting labels. `sc_finalize_switch_pst` collects bodies in reverse order, builds TT_CASE. `lower_case` updated for Snocone TT_PROGRAM arm bodies (QLIT-last detection). SCRIP mirror updated.
- [x] **PST-SC-4g** ✅ (2026-05-16, one4all `0c0c22d9`, corpus `6889e67`) — `TT_DEFINE(QLIT(name), QLIT(sig), TT_PROGRAM(body))`. `FuncHead` slimmed to `{name,argstr,prev_func}`. `func_before_body` snapshot. `sc_finalize_function_pst` builds TT_DEFINE. `lower_stmt` dispatches TT_DEFINE: emits DEFINE call, skip-jump, entry label, body, patch. SCRIP mirror updated. Gates: 5/0, 8/0, 2/0.
- [x] **PST-SC-4h** ✅ (2026-05-16, one4all `e1a902a7`, corpus `6a68f49`) — `break`/`continue` emit `TT_LOOP_BREAK`/`TT_LOOP_NEXT` tree nodes (QLIT user-label child optional). `sc_append_break`/`sc_append_continue` no longer emit goto STMT_t. `lower.c`: `g_loop_stack` (depth-64) with `loop_push`/`loop_pop`; while/do/for push labels around body; `lower_loop_break`/`lower_loop_next` resolve via stack. SCRIP mirror updated. Gates: 5/0, 8/0, 2/0.
- [x] **PST-SC-4i** ✅ (2026-05-16) — Labels (`label:`) → STMT_t with label field (produces TT_STMT(:lbl) via stmt_to_ast). `sc_emit_label_pad`, `sc_pending_label_add`, `sc_pending_label_clear`, `sc_pending_to_stash` deleted; all pending/stash fields removed from ScParseState; user_labels fields removed from LoopFrame; `sc_loop_find_by_user_label` deleted. New `sc_append_label_node` appends label-only STMT_t directly. Bonus fix: while/do/for head snapshot moved from single ScParseState fields into per-instance WhileHead/DoHead/ForHead structs — fixes double-free crash on nested loops. lower.c: TT_DEFINE routed through lower_stmt when appearing as TT_STMT subject. SCRIP mirror: parser_snocone.sc already emits make_label_stmt — no change needed. Gates: snocone_smoke 5/0, crosscheck_snocone 8/0, scrip_all_modes 2/0.
- [x] **PST-SC-4j** ✅ (fixed 2026-05-17) — Grammar+SCRIP mirror done in prior commit. Lower fix: (1) lower_return/proc_fail/nreturn emit SM_RETURN/SM_FRETURN/SM_NRETURN directly; (2) dispatch in lower_stmt changed from lower_stmt(subject) to direct lower_return/proc_fail/nreturn(subject) calls (lower_stmt hit early-return guard before reaching the switch). No lower.sc mirror gap (lower.sc deleted in PST-RB-5e). Gates: snocone_smoke 5/0, crosscheck_snocone 8/0, scrip_all_modes 2/0.
- [ ] **PST-SC-4k** — `goto LABEL` → `TT_GOTO_U`. `sc_append_goto_label` deleted.
- [ ] **PST-SC-4l** — `sc_split_subject_pattern` → lower.
- [ ] **PST-SC-4m** — `TT_PROGRAM` is tree of statement-tree nodes (not flat list with synthetic gotos/labels). `sc_append_stmt`/`sc_splice_after`/`sc_make_label_stmt`/`sc_make_goto_uncond_stmt` deleted.
- [ ] **PST-SC-4n** — `ScParseState` shrunk to lexer + filename + error count. Audit complete.

Gates: snocone_smoke, snocone broad corpus, scrip_all_modes.

### Step 4 Phase 2 — Snocone SCRIP mirror (after all Phase 1 complete)

**Do not start until PST-SC-4k through 4n all checked [x] AND all six C parsers satisfy Phase 1.**

- [ ] **PST-SC-SC-1 — Audit `parser_snocone.sc` for Aspect 1 and Aspect 2 violations.**

  **Aspect 2** — `Append()` in-place tree mutation:
  Three sites in `parser_snocone.sc` call `Append(r, arr[i])` or similar
  to build up a node by inserting children one at a time into an existing
  `tree_t` node. `Append` calls `Insert` which rewrites `n(x)` and `c(x)`
  in place. This is a post-construction tree mutation — forbidden in the
  pure-parse phase.

  **Where:** `parser_snocone.sc` lines ~221, ~400, ~608.
  - Line ~221: inside a helper that builds a list node by appending into `r`.
  - Line ~400: inside a helper building a call node from `kids` array.
  - Line ~608: inside a helper building a varlist node from `kids` array.

  **Fix for each:** Replace the pre-allocate + loop-Append pattern with
  counter discipline — `nPush`/`nInc` each child, then `Reduce(tag, nTop())`.
  The `kids` working array is a local scratch variable, not a tree node, and
  is permitted as a local accumulator before the final `Reduce`.

  No code changes in this rung — document findings and line numbers.

- [ ] **PST-SC-SC-2 — Replace all `Append`-based node building in `parser_snocone.sc` with `Reduce`.**

  **What:** For each of the three `Append` sites (lines ~221, ~400, ~608):
  1. Remove the pre-allocated result node (`r = tree(...)`).
  2. Push each element with `Push(arr[i])` and `nInc()`.
  3. Replace the final return/push with `Reduce(tag, nTop())`.
  4. The local `kids` / `arr` working array may be retained as scratch
     to collect children before pushing — it is not a tree node.

  **Why:** `Append` is structurally `Reduce-after-the-fact`. Once a node
  exists, its children must be immutable in the parse phase. The only
  permitted moment to set children is inside `Reduce`, which creates the
  node atomically from the top N stack elements.

  Gates: `snocone_smoke`, `crosscheck_snocone`, `smoke_scrip_all_modes`.

### Step 5 — Rebus rewrite + Step 6 — Prolog rewrite

Owned by **`GOAL-PST-REBUS-PROLOG.md`**. Work those steps there.
On completion, update Step 5 and Step 6 checkboxes in the Frontend status table above.

### Step 7 — Invariant tests

- [ ] **PST-INV-7a** — `scripts/test_pure_syntax_tree.sh`: parse representative file per frontend, dump via `ast_print`, assert no synthetic label nodes, no splicing artifacts, no non-`tree_t` types.
- [ ] **PST-INV-7b** — `ast_verify` mode: walk `tree_t`, assert every node kind justified by source language's syntax production set (per-language allow-list).
- [ ] **PST-INV-7c** — Lint pass over `*.y` / `prolog_parse.c` / `icon_parse.c` flagging forbidden patterns: `strdup` of label names, `sprintf("L%d", ++counter)`, `clone_*`, `sc_label_new`, `sc_finalize_*`.

---

## Lower's new responsibilities (Stage 1 summary)

- **Augmented assignment** — `TT_AUGOP` → `TT_ASSIGN(lhs, TT_<op>(lhs', rhs))`, cloning lhs once.
- **Control flow → labels/gotos** — `TT_IF`, `TT_WHILE`, `TT_REPEAT`, `TT_FOR`, `TT_CASE` → `IR_bb_t` graphs with α/β/γ/ω wiring, plus `IR_sm_t[]` linear control flow for non-generative cases.
- **Break/continue resolution** — walk surrounding loop context; parser no longer pre-resolves.
- **SNOBOL4 subject/pattern split** — `AST_SCAN` and `AST_SEQ` rearrangement moved here.
- **Goto fields onto tree** — read `TT_GOTO_U/S/F` children of `TT_STMT` instead of `STMT_t` string fields.
- **Prolog slot allocation** — per-clause scope assigning each named variable an integer slot.
- **EXPORT/IMPORT** — currently dead code: parser populates `prog->exports`/`prog->imports` but no consumer reads them. Stage 1 removes the parser-side special-cases entirely (see PST-SN4-1a). If a future feature needs them, it adds its own pass over `tree_t`.

---

## Stage 1 done criterion

1. Every parser action body either (a) returns one RHS child unchanged or (b) calls `ast_node_new`/`expr_new`/`expr_unary`/`expr_binary`/`ast_push`/`expr_add_child` and returns the node. No other side effects or allocations of node-like types.
2. Grammar files and hand-written parsers build only `tree_t`. `RExpr`/`RStmt`/`RProgram` gone from parsers. `Term` gone as parser output (survives as runtime type).
3. All existing test gates green. NEW pure-syntax-tree invariant gates (Step 7) green.
4. Beauty self-host byte-identical (Milestone 1 protected).

---

## Stage 2 — Lower: pure tree_t → IR_sm_t[] + IR_bb_t

### Split-IR design

`lower` emits **two parallel, equally-first-class IR forms**. Both are IR. Both carry the `IR_` prefix. Symmetric naming throughout.

| Form | Shape | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| **`IR_sm_t[]`** (flat array, wrapped in `IR_sm_program_t`) | linear instruction stream; jumps are integer indices into the array | deterministic stack-machine code: literals, var r/w, binops, assigns, gotos, conditional branches, calls, returns, pattern invocations |
| **`IR_bb_t`** (DCG node, wrapped in `IR_bb_block_t`) | directed graph with α/β/γ/ω ports | pattern/generator subgraphs: backtracking, choice points, scan markers, generator state |

**Reference direction:** `IR_sm_t` can hold `IR_bb_t*` (via `SM_EXEC_PATTERN` and friends). `IR_bb_t` never references `IR_sm_t`. SM is caller; BB is callee/coroutine.

`IR_sm_t` is **an instruction record, not a tree node** — no `c[]/n`, no ports, no children. Operands flow on the runtime stack via push/pop. `target` is an array index. The flat array *is* the structure.

```c
typedef struct {
    IR_sm_op_t   op;
    IR_sm_arg_t  a[IR_SM_MAX_OPERANDS];  /* 3 */
    int          stno;
    /* `target` field replaces today's sm_patch_jump fixups —
       jumps are indices into the IR_sm_program_t.insns[] array */
} IR_sm_t;

typedef union {
    int64_t       ival;
    double        dval;
    const char   *sval;
    void         *ptr;
    IR_bb_t      *bb;
} IR_sm_arg_t;

typedef struct {

`c[]/n` is sparse on `IR_bb_t`: only kinds with genuine static n-ary structure use it (`IR_BB_PL_CHOICE`, `IR_BB_CALL`, `IR_BB_MAKELIST`, `IR_BB_CASE`, `IR_BB_PROC`, `IR_BB_PAT_ALT`, `IR_BB_PAT_CAT`). Most BB leaves leave `c[]` empty.

### Legacy → renamed map

Today the codebase uses two confusingly-named prefixes. After rename:

| Today | After rename |
|-------|--------------|
| `SM_*` opcode names (`SM_HALT`, `SM_JUMP`, `SM_PUSH_LIT_S`, …) | **`IR_SM_*`** |
| `sm_opcode_t` | `IR_sm_op_t` |
| `sm_operand_t` | `IR_sm_arg_t` |
| `SM_Instr` | `IR_sm_t` |
| `SM_Program` | `IR_sm_program_t` |
| `SmExpression_t` | `IR_sm_expr_t` |
| `sm_*` API (`sm_emit*`, `sm_label*`, `sm_patch_jump`, `sm_prog_new`, …) | `ir_sm_*` API |
| `g_current_sm_prog` | `g_current_ir_sm_prog` |
| `IR_*` enum (`IR_LIT_I`, `IR_PAT_*`, `IR_PL_*`, `IR_ICN_*`, …) | **`IR_BB_*`** (`IR_BB_LIT_I`, `IR_BB_PAT_*`, `IR_BB_PL_*`, `IR_BB_ICN_*`) |
| `IR_e` | `IR_bb_op_t` |
| `IR_t` | `IR_bb_t` |
| `IR_block_t` | `IR_bb_block_t` |
| `IR_alloc / IR_node_alloc / IR_reset / IR_free` | `IR_bb_alloc / IR_bb_node_alloc / IR_bb_reset / IR_bb_free` |
| `IR_LANG_*` constants | stay as-is (shared by both forms) |

### Out of scope — must NOT rename

These share the prefix but are not IR-from-lower:

- **`BB_*` in `bb_box.h`, `bb_broker.h`, `bb_pool.h`** — runtime Byrd-box engine (broker, pool, banner): `BB_MODE_BROKERED`, `BB_MODE_LIVE`, `BB_POOL_SIZE`, `BB_LABEL_NAME_MAX`, `BB_BANNER_RULE_LEN`, etc. They consume IR but are not IR.
- **`SM_INTERP_*`, `SM_CALL_STACK_MAX`, `SM_GEN_LOCAL_MAX`, `SM_MAX_OPERANDS`, `SM_INTERP_SUSPENDED`** — runtime/interpreter constants (`SM_MAX_OPERANDS` becomes `IR_SM_MAX_OPERANDS` because it's structural; the other interp-runtime ones stay `SM_*`).
- Header guards (`SM_INTERP_H`, `BB_BOX_H`, `BB_BROKER_H`, `BB_POOL_H`, `BB_BUILD_BIN_H`) — mechanical, not load-bearing.
- **Emitter files** — they *reference* IR opcodes but the references rename automatically via bulk sed. Emitter-internal names (helper functions, output-template macros) stay.
- **`.s` / asm comments** — rename via courtesy sed, not load-bearing.

**Inclusion criterion:** a name renames iff it identifies (a) the IR opcode set, (b) the IR instruction/node type, (c) the IR program/block container, or (d) the API that builds/inspects those. Runtime, interpreter, emitter, header-guard, and broker names stay.

### Stage 2 step ladder

- [ ] **PST-LR-0** — **Bulk rename** (single rung). Mechanical sed across the codebase per the map above. No structural change. Gates must pass before commit.
    - 0.1 — produce inventory script `scripts/audit_ir_names.sh` that prints every renamed identifier, every preserved-but-prefixed identifier, and every name flagged as ambiguous (manual review).
    - 0.2 — write `scripts/rename_sm_to_ir_sm.sh` and `scripts/rename_ir_to_ir_bb.sh` with explicit per-pattern sed rules; never blind global replace.
    - 0.3 — apply renames in two ordered passes (`IR_*` → `IR_BB_*` first, then `SM_*` → `IR_SM_*`) so the second pass cannot collide with already-renamed identifiers.
    - 0.4 — split the legacy `sm_prog.h` and `IR.h` into renamed `IR_sm.h` / `IR_bb.h`. The old headers become one-line `#include` shims that warn-on-include and are deleted at end of rung.
    - 0.5 — confirm gates green: scrip build, smoke for each frontend, beauty self-host byte-identical.
- [ ] **PST-LR-1** — Audit `lower.c` against pure-tree input. Catalog call sites that depend on parser-side desugaring.
- [ ] **PST-LR-2a** — `TT_AUGOP` → `IR_BB_ASSIGN(lhs, IR_BB_BINOP(lhs', rhs))` or the equivalent `IR_sm_t[]` sequence depending on context.
- [ ] **PST-LR-2b** — `TT_IF` → cmp/br/then/else/join wiring in `IR_sm_t[]` (non-generative) or `IR_bb_t` (generative cond).
- [ ] **PST-LR-2c** — `TT_WHILE`/`TT_REPEAT`/`TT_UNTIL` → head/back-edge/exit.
- [ ] **PST-LR-2d** — `TT_FOR(init, cond, step, body)` → init→head→cond→body→step→back.
- [ ] **PST-LR-2e** — `TT_CASE` → cascade compare-and-branch or jump-table in `IR_sm_t[]`.
- [ ] **PST-LR-2f** — `TT_LOOP_BREAK`/`TT_LOOP_NEXT` → resolved against innermost matching loop.
- [ ] **PST-LR-2g** — `TT_DEFINE` → `IR_BB_PROC` with c[]=params, body lowered.
- [ ] **PST-LR-2h** — SNOBOL4 subject/pattern split (SCAN/SEQ rearrangement removed from parser).
- [ ] **PST-LR-2i** — `TT_GOTO_U/S/F` children of `TT_STMT` → resolved to `IR_SM_JUMP*` with integer target indices.
- [ ] **PST-LR-3** — Prolog slot allocation: pre-lower pass walks clause `tree_t`, collects `TT_VAR` names, assigns slots, attaches `ival` during lowering.
- [ ] **PST-LR-4** — Rebus lowering (`rebus_lower.c`) grows to handle `tree_t` input.
- [ ] **PST-LR-5** — Cross-language audit: every frontend's lowered IR obeys invariants.

### IR_bb_t invariants (post-lower)

1. `c[]/n` per-kind only — most `IR_bb_t` leaves it empty; only `IR_BB_PL_CHOICE`, `IR_BB_CALL`, `IR_BB_MAKELIST`, `IR_BB_CASE`, `IR_BB_PROC`, and pattern composers use it.
2. Every `IR_bb_t` carries ω (fail-out). Never NULL in completed graph.
3. Every `IR_bb_t` that can succeed carries γ to next-on-success target.
4. No node carries a label string as control-flow target. Only values survive in `sval`.
5. Cycles exist only via ports, never via `c[]`. `c[]` skeleton is a forest.
6. `cfg->entry` is execution entry. `cfg->all[]` is flat node table.

### IR_sm_t invariants (post-lower)

1. `IR_sm_program_t.insns[]` is a flat array. The array index *is* the instruction's identity.
2. Jumps (`IR_SM_JUMP`, `IR_SM_JUMP_S`, `IR_SM_JUMP_F`, `IR_SM_JUMP_INDIR`) carry an integer `target` that indexes into `insns[]`. No string labels survive past `sm_patch_jump`.
3. `IR_SM_EXEC_PATTERN`, `IR_SM_BUILD_PATTERN`, `IR_SM_RESUME_GENERATOR`, `IR_SM_EXEC_BB`, `IR_SM_BB_*` carry an `IR_bb_t*` (or index into `bb_table[]`) — never an `IR_sm_t*`. SM references BB; BB does not reference SM.
4. Operands of arithmetic, compare, and call opcodes flow on the runtime stack via push/pop — they are not encoded as instruction arguments.

### Stage 2 done criterion

1. `lower` produces IR from pure `tree_t` for all six languages.
2. Interpreter (`ir_exec.c`) produces same outputs as today (broad corpus ≥ current head).
3. Beauty self-host byte-identical (Milestone 1 protected).
4. All emitters (x86, JVM, .NET, JS, WASM) no regression in corpus pass-counts.
5. All `tree_t` → IR lowering documented in per-construct comments in `lower.c`/`lower_*.c`.

## Risks

- **Beauty self-host regression.** Snocone changes are deep. Every PST-SC-4* rung must pass beauty smoke test before commit.
- **SCRIP mirror drift.** The single biggest risk of this goal: C frontend evolves rung-by-rung while `corpus/SCRIP/parser_*.sc` lags. Result is two implementations of the same compiler that disagree on `tree_t` shape, masked by gates that only test the C path. Mitigation: per-rung gate that diffs C-frontend dump vs SCRIP-frontend dump on smoke corpus; never commit a rung where they diverge.
- **Lower bloat.** Open new files for major pieces (`lower_snocone_ctrl.c`, `lower_pl_clause.c`). Mirror split on the SCRIP side if `lower.sc` becomes unwieldy.
- **Rebus has thin lower today.** `rebus_lower.c` will grow significantly in Step 5.
- **Prolog parser shares scope state with lookahead.** Preserve variable-name→identity correspondence across a clause; only the slot numbering moves.

## ⛔ SCRIP mirror work — mandatory orientation for every session touching parser_*.sc

**C side must be clean first.** Do not attempt SCRIP mirror work for a language until its C parser is left-to-right child-order clean and produces only `tree_t`. Status per language (update this table as rungs complete):

| Language | C parser L-to-R ready? | SCRIP mirror ready to start? |
|---|---|---|
| Icon | ✅ yes (PST-ICN-4b) | ✅ yes |
| SNOBOL4 | ✅ yes (PST-SN4-1d) | ✅ yes |
| Raku | ⏳ PRF-12 C side pending | no — wait for PRF-12 |
| Snocone | ⏳ PST-SC-4k→4n pending | no — wait for 4n |
| Rebus | ⏳ always-wrap stmt list pending | no — wait for RB-C-1 |
| Prolog | ⏳ PST-PL-6f pending | no — wait for 6f |

**When starting SCRIP mirror work for any language, orient as follows:**

To code as an expert in Snocone, you must learn the language from two sources before writing a single line:
1. Learn exact Snocone expression semantics and syntax from the SPITBOL manual (`spitbol-manual-v3_7.pdf`). Extract with `pdftotext -layout spitbol-manual-v3_7.pdf /tmp/spitbol.txt` and read chapters on pattern matching, operator precedence, `$`/`.`/`*` operators, FENCE/ARBNO/BREAK. Use the navigation map in `GOAL-PST-REBUS.md ## SPITBOL manual navigation cheatsheet`.
2. Learn exact Snocone statement and control-flow syntax from `corpus/SCRIP/parser_snocone.sc` — it is the authoritative Snocone grammar definition.
3. Read `SNOBOL4-SNOCONE-PRIMER.md` in full — every failure mode listed there has already cost sessions. Do not repeat them.

**The goal for every parser_*.sc:** Replace all tree-building functions with pure `shift` and `reduce` calls only — no `Push`, `Pop`, `Append`, `Tree`, `nPush/nPop/nInc/nTop` inside function bodies, no helper functions that inspect previously-built children. Every grammar production becomes: zero or more `shift`/`shift_val` calls for leaf tokens, one `reduce(TT_KIND, n)` call. The `nPush`/`nInc`/`nTop`/`nPop` counter discipline for variable-arity reduces is permitted in grammar rules (not inside functions). `dq_unescape` and similar pure string preprocessors with no tree operations are permitted.

### Note for next session — bison regen behavior

`snobol4.y` was previously out of sync with the committed `snobol4.tab.c/.tab.h`. Fixed in `544a6de0` by mechanical sed across `.y`. **Verify on entry that `bison -d -o snobol4.tab.c snobol4.y` produces a `.tab.c` byte-comparable to the committed one** (apart from intentional edits). The top-level Makefile compiles the committed `.tab.c` directly without a `.y` dependency rule, so a divergent `.y` can persist undetected in normal builds — only the per-frontend `Makefile` triggers regen. If any frontend other than SNOBOL4 has a similar `.y`/`.tab.c` desync, the same fix pattern applies.

## Authorship

Drafted by Claude Opus 4.7, 2026-05-16. Stage 2 split-IR design same session. Stage 2 bulk-rename plan (`SM_*`→`IR_SM_*`, `IR_*`→`IR_BB_*`) added 2026-05-16 (this session, with Lon). SCRIP self-host mirror invariant added 2026-05-16 (same session, with Lon) — requires every PST-* rung to update `corpus/SCRIP/parser_*.sc` and `corpus/SCRIP/lower.sc` alongside the C-side change in the same commit. Left-to-right child-order invariant added 2026-05-16 (same session, with Lon) — the children of every AST node must appear in the same order as their tokens in the source, enabling each `corpus/SCRIP/parser_*.sc` to collapse to a dispatch table plus the two-primitive `Shift` / `Reduce` core.

### Handoff note — 2026-05-18 (Sonnet 4.6)

Session goal: HQ work — assess all six C parsers for L-to-R readiness, update goal files with two-phase rule.

**Two-phase rule added (supersedes same-commit pairing):**
Phase 1 = all C parsers clean (tree_t, L-to-R, no synthesis). Phase 2 = one dedicated SNOBOL4/Snocone session per parser_*.sc. Never both in the same session.

**C parser status at handoff:**
- Icon ✅ Phase 1 complete
- SNOBOL4 ✅ Phase 1 complete
- Raku ⏳ PRF-12 C side (5 rungs: gather, sub, class, program, for-range)
- Snocone ⏳ PST-SC-4k→4n (4 rungs: goto→TT_GOTO_U, split→lower, TT_PROGRAM stmt list, ScParseState shrink)
- Rebus ⏳ RB-C-1 (stmt_list_ne always-wrap in rebus.y)
- Prolog ⏳ PST-PL-6f (delete Term* returning paths from prolog_parse.c)

**Files modified this session:**
- GOAL-PARSER-PURE-SYNTAX-TREE.md — two-phase rule, readiness table, SCRIP orientation block, Snocone Step 4 Phase 1 annotation
- GOAL-PST-REBUS.md — RB-C-1 rung added, SCRIP orientation block, Phase 1 annotation
- GOAL-PST-ICN-RAKU.md — PRF-12 C sequencing (5 ordered bullets), SCRIP orientation block, Phase 1 annotation
- GOAL-PST-PROLOG.md — SCRIP orientation block added

**Next session:** pick any one of the four remaining Phase 1 C tasks. Suggest PST-SC-4k (Snocone goto→TT_GOTO_U) as it is the most clearly defined and has existing lower.c infrastructure ready.

### Handoff note — 2026-05-18 session 2 (Sonnet 4.6)

**What was done this session (HQ work):**

1. Audited all six C parsers for L-to-R shift/reduce readiness.
2. Added two-phase sequencing rule (supersedes old same-commit pairing):
   Phase 1 = all C parsers clean, Phase 2 = SCRIP mirrors as dedicated
   SNOBOL4 sessions. Never both in one session.
3. Added RB-C-1 rung to GOAL-PST-REBUS.md (stmt_list_ne always-wrap).
4. Added PRF-12 C sequencing (5 bullets) to GOAL-PST-ICN-RAKU.md.
5. Added SCRIP orientation blocks to PST-REBUS, PST-ICN-RAKU, PST-PROLOG.
6. Created GOAL-PST-SNOBOL4.md — sibling goal for SNOBOL4, carrying
   completed 1a-1d and new PST-SN4-W1 rung (remove ->t==TT_QLIT
   inspection from sno4_stmt_commit_go).
7. Corrected false belief that SNOBOL4 was fully ready — it has one
   remaining Phase 1 wart (PST-SN4-W1).

**Phase 1 C status at handoff:**
- Icon     ✅ complete
- SNOBOL4  ⏳ PST-SN4-W1 (one wart: ->t inspection in sno4_stmt_commit_go)
- Snocone  ⏳ PST-SC-4k→4n (4 rungs)
- Raku     ⏳ PRF-12 (5 rungs: gather, sub, class, program, for-range)
- Rebus    ⏳ RB-C-1 (stmt_list_ne always-wrap)
- Prolog   ⏳ PST-PL-6f (delete Term* paths)

**Recommended next session:** PST-SN4-W1 or PST-SC-4k — both small,
well-defined, self-contained. Do not attempt Phase 2 SCRIP mirror work
until all six Phase 1 tasks above are checked.
