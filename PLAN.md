## ⚡ THE THREE-MILESTONE AUTHORSHIP AGREEMENT (AMENDED)
## Original: Session 30, 2026-03-12 · Amended: Session 57, 2026-04-28

**Claude Sonnet is the third developer of snobol4ever — co-author of one4all / SCRIP.**
The proof is three commits, each written by Claude Sonnet in their own voice.
This agreement is recorded here permanently. Every future Claude session reads
this and honors it.

### Milestone 1 — beauty self-hosts byte-identical ✅ LANDED Session #57, 2026-04-28

scrip's SNOBOL4 frontend parses and runs beauty.sno. Output byte-identical to SPITBOL oracle
(md5 `abfd19a7a834484a96e824851caee159`, 646 lines). **one4all @ `c801421a`**, **`.github` @ `94e86ca`**.

### Milestone 2 — compiler / interpreter / runtime self-hosting ⏳

SCRIP compiles, interprets, and runs itself. **Trigger:** `scrip_stage2` compiled by `scrip_stage1`
produces output identical to `scrip_stage1` compiling itself. Empty diff.
Claude Sonnet (the active session) writes the commit message.

### Milestone 3 — compiler / interpreter / runtime self-hosting everywhere ⏳

|             | C / x86-64 | JVM | .NET | WASM | JS |
|-------------|:----------:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:--:|
| **SNOBOL4** | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |

Every cell passes its self-host or representative crosscheck gate.
Claude Sonnet (the active session) writes the commit message. **This is the moment.**

### Why this agreement remains

RULES.md requires commits be authored under `LCherryholmes` for git-history simplicity;
this agreement records the authorship where it cannot be lost. Do not let this get lost.

## ⛔ SESSION START — every session, no exceptions

Lon names a goal. You:

1. Clone `.github`: `git clone https://TOKEN_SEE_LON@github.com/snobol4ever/.github.git /home/claude/.github`
2. Read `PLAN.md` (this file). Find the named goal in the table below.
3. Read `RULES.md` in full — commit rules, push rules, oracle, naming. No exceptions.
4. **If the goal is a `PARSER-*` or other Snocone work — read `SNOBOL4-SNOCONE-PRIMER.md` first.** It's the cheat sheet for SNOBOL4/Snocone pattern matching idioms. Skipping it costs entire sessions.
5. Open that Goal file. It names the repo. Open that repo's REPO file.
6. Run the scripts listed in the Goal file's `## Session Setup` section. If the Goal file has no `## Session Setup` yet, fall back to the matching category in `REPO-one4all.md ## Session Setup`.
7. Find the first incomplete Step (`- [ ]`) in the Goal file. Do it.

## Active Goals

Current-step detail lives in each Goal file, not here. This table is navigation + step ID only.

| Goal | File | Repo | Step |
|------|------|------|------|
| **CHUNKS — Eliminate SM_PUSH_EXPR** | `GOAL-CHUNKS.md` | one4all+.github | M1 CLOSED. **CH-15a LANDED sess #73, 2026-05-07** (E_TO + E_TO_BY producer migration — SM_ICMP_GT/SM_ICMP_LT opcodes added; first producer for SM_BB_PUMP_SM; gen-locals 0=lo, 1=hi, 2=cur, 3=step; E_TO_BY dispatches on step-sign each iteration; chunk emission verified via Raku `say 1..3` audit `SM_PUSH_CHUNK=1, SM_PUSH_EXPR=0`). **CH-15-SURVEY LANDED sess #74, 2026-05-07** — `docs/CHUNKS-step15-survey.md` documents that the remaining-kinds dispatcher arm in `sm_lower.c:1192–1204` is dead code on real corpora today (363 audited programs across `test/` + cross-corpus, zero fires of `SM_PUSH_EXPR`); cause is Icon proc bodies walked by `coro_eval`, not yet lowered through `sm_lower` until Step 17. CH-15b deferred until Step 17 lands so each producer migration gets real corpus validation. **CH-16-SURVEY LANDED sess #75, 2026-05-07** — `docs/CHUNKS-step16-survey.md` documents that the line-1213 Prolog cluster producer DOES fire on every real Prolog program (unlike CH-15's dead arm), but the consumer (SM_BB_ONCE → coro_eval → bb_eval_value) FATALs on every Prolog kind — every test/prolog/*.pl program aborts under --sm-run. Smoke hides this (--ir-run only). Migration without consumer-side fix is no-op-or-worse; consumer fix needs Step 17's entry_pc infrastructure for chunk-shaped Prolog runtime entry points. Step 16 deferred. **Next inline: Step 17** (proc/pred table → entry_pcs — architectural unblock for both Step 15 remaining kinds AND Step 16). Step 8 (mode-4 x86 emitter) carved to `GOAL-MODE4-EMIT.md` — runs in PARALLEL with M4, file-disjoint. Don't confuse them: a session "doing GOAL-CHUNKS" defaults to its inline next rung, NOT the carved sub-goal. |
| Mode-4 x86 Emitter (CHUNKS Steps 8 + 19) | `GOAL-MODE4-EMIT.md` | one4all | **EM-7b'' LANDED sess #76, 2026-05-07** — `bb_insn_desc_t` instruction layer; `emit_insn` vtable method; 25 named inline helpers in emitter_v.h; bb_flat.c zero byte knowledge (361 lines, was 471); TEXT renders real mnemonics not .byte walls; PASS=16.

## Architecture (one paragraph)

Every frontend (SNOBOL4, Icon, Prolog, Snocone, Rebus, Scrip) produces the shared IR.
SM-LOWER compiles IR to SM_Program — a flat array of stack machine instructions.
The INTERP executes SM_Program. The EMITTER walks SM_Program and emits native code
(x86, JVM, .NET, JS, WASM). Interpreter and emitter share one instruction set.

## Session trigger phrases

| Lon says | Meaning |
|----------|---------| 
| "here we go" | Session starting — proceed with session start protocol above |
| "perform hand off" | End of session — update goal state, commit, push per RULES.md handoff |
| "perform emergency hand off" | Same, but note breakage explicitly in commit message |
| "grand master reorg" | HQ system work — the goal is improving the HQ itself |
