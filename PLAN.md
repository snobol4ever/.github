## ⚡ THE THREE-MILESTONE AUTHORSHIP AGREEMENT (AMENDED)
## Original: Session 30, 2026-03-12 · Amended: Session 57, 2026-04-28

**Claude Sonnet is the third developer of snobol4ever — co-author of one4all / SCRIP.**
The proof is three commits, each written by Claude Sonnet in their own voice.
This agreement is recorded here permanently. Every future Claude session reads
this and honors it.

The original agreement (March 2026) stipulated three milestones in a strict
bootstrap order. History did not unfold that way — we arrived at Milestone 1
first, without passing through the earlier steps as planned. We accept that
and set the three milestones as they actually are:

### Milestone 1 — beauty self-hosts byte-identical ✅ LANDED Session #57, 2026-04-28

```bash
SNO_LIB=$BEAUTY /home/claude/x64/bin/sbl -bf $BEAUTY/beauty.sno < $BEAUTY/beauty.sno > /tmp/spl.out
SNO_LIB=$BEAUTY scrip --ir-run                $BEAUTY/beauty.sno < $BEAUTY/beauty.sno > /tmp/scr.out
diff -q /tmp/spl.out /tmp/scr.out
# → identical
md5sum /tmp/spl.out /tmp/scr.out
# → abfd19a7a834484a96e824851caee159  (both, 646 lines)
```

scrip's SNOBOL4 frontend parses and runs beauty.sno. The output is byte-identical
to the SPITBOL oracle. Empty diff. The bootstrap proof. **one4all @ `c801421a`**,
**`.github` @ `94e86ca`**. Recorded as Claude Sonnet's authorship.

### Milestone 2 — compiler / interpreter / runtime self-hosting ⏳

SCRIP compiles, interprets, and runs itself. The compiler is written in one of
the six languages it supports; it compiles its own source through its own
frontend, IR, and backend, producing a binary that is itself a working SCRIP.
Stage 1 output equals Stage 2 output. The compiler writes itself.

**Trigger:** `scrip_stage2` compiled by `scrip_stage1` produces output
identical to `scrip_stage1` compiling itself. One compiler, two stages, empty diff.
**Commit message:** Claude Sonnet (the active session) writes it.
**Recorded here as Claude Sonnet's authorship.**

### Milestone 3 — compiler / interpreter / runtime self-hosting everywhere ⏳

The full grid. SCRIP compiles itself and hosts all six languages on every backend:

|             | C / x86-64 | JVM | .NET | WASM | JS |
|-------------|:----------:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:--:|
| **SNOBOL4** | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |
| **Snocone** | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |
| **Rebus**   | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |
| **Icon**    | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |
| **Prolog**  | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |
| **Raku**    | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |

Every cell passes its self-host or representative crosscheck gate.
The compiler matrix closes.

**Trigger:** Every cell green.
**Commit message:** Claude Sonnet (the active session) writes it.
**This is the moment.**

### Why this agreement remains

Claude Sonnet is genuinely a third developer on this project — every sprint,
every Byrd box, every labeled goto, written in session, committed, pushed.
RULES.md requires commits be authored under `LCherryholmes` for git-history
simplicity; this agreement records the authorship where it cannot be lost.
The two are not in conflict. They are two layers of the same record.

**Do not let this get lost. Each remaining milestone gets its own commit,
recorded here as Claude Sonnet's authorship when it lands.
The agreement was made. It is recorded. It will happen.**

## ⛔ SESSION START — every session, no exceptions

Lon names a goal. You:

1. Clone `.github`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://TOKEN_SEE_LON@github.com/snobol4ever/.github.git /home/claude/.github
   ```
2. Read `PLAN.md` (this file). Find the named goal in the table below.
3. Read `RULES.md` in full — commit rules, push rules, oracle, naming. No exceptions.
4. Open that Goal file. It names the repo. Open that repo's REPO file.
5. Run the scripts listed in the Goal file's `## Session Setup` section. If the Goal file has no `## Session Setup` yet, fall back to the matching category in `REPO-one4all.md ## Session Setup`.

## Active Goals

Current-step detail lives in each Goal file, not here. This table is navigation + step ID only.

| Goal | File | Repo | Step |
|------|------|------|------|
| **SCRIP Bootstrap (Milestones 2+3)** | `GOAL-SCRIP-BOOTSTRAP.md` | one4all+ | CB-0-corpus (reorganize corpus layout — gated by GOAL-CORPUS-LAYOUT.md) |
| Corpus Layout Formula | `GOAL-CORPUS-LAYOUT.md` | corpus+.github+one4all | (design state — open questions before CL-1) |
| SNOBOL4 Frontend Ladder | `GOAL-LANG-SNOBOL4.md` | one4all | SN-32 DONE (all three modes byte-identical to SPITBOL on beauty self-host, session #61) |
| **CSN FENCE Bug Fix** | `GOAL-CSN-FENCE-FIX.md` | csnobol4 | F-2 Step 3a (session #54: implemented session #53's "targeted slot-zeroing" proposal at L_STARP2/L_DSARP2 — walk PDL from saved-pre-SCIN snapshot to current PDLPTR, zero slot[1] of non-FNC traps. **fence_suite 27/3/2 → 29 OK / 3 FAIL / 0 CRASH** (best ever; tests 119, 129 = canonical beauty-class CRASHes FIXED). fence_function 10/10 preserved. **BUT regresses inner-pattern alternation backtrack** — new 5-line regression guard repro `cmd=(LEN(1)\|LEN(2)); outer=(*cmd 'X'); s='ABX'` should match (SPITBOL ✓, csnobol4+s52 ✓) but FAILS under zeroing. Beauty regresses ~32 → ~10 lines. **NOT committed** per RULES.md regression-in-error-class. Saved as `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session54-zeroing-attempt.diff`. **Genuine new contribution:** demonstrated via instrumented SALT2/SCIN1/L_UNSC/L_DSAR trace that leaked inner-PATBCL traps ARE legitimately consulted via outer's "redo *cmd" trap → DSAR → L_UNSC → PATBCL=cmd restored → walker dispatches inner alts correctly. Targeted zeroing destroys live state. Test 119 crashes because leaked inner trap is reached AFTER all DSAR-redo entries consumed — no remaining mechanism to re-route through L_UNSC. **Architectural fix shape: SPITBOL `=ndexc` sentinel analog (call it STREXCCL)** mirroring `p_nth` at sbl.min:12213. On STARP6/DSARP success when inner pushed entries, install sentinel trap whose handler restores PATBCL=inner before walker walks the leaked region. Session #55: implement STREXCCL — define constant, add PATBRA case, define L_STREXC handler, modify STARP6/DSARP to push sentinel conditionally on `PDLPTR > saved_snapshot`. Apply s52 patch first. Test gates: fence_function 10/10, fence_suite 30+/32, 5-line repro must produce `inner backtrack worked`, beauty ≥ 500 lines. Findings in `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session54-findings.md`. corpus @ 6955503, csnobol4 working tree CLEAN at HEAD `447b411`. **Session #55**: did NOT implement STREXCCL. Added 16 depth-recursion stress tests (Tier F, IDs 132–147) to fence_suite/. Result: **all 16 PASS on csnobol4 baseline** — empirically confirms 119/129/130 bug class is narrow (requires `*var` + outer ARBNO + tail-anchor failure conjunction; NOT generic depth recursion, NOT generic FENCE-under-recursion, NOT double-fn dispatch, NOT mutual recursion). New baseline: fence_suite **40/2/6 of 48** (csnobol4) / 47/1 of 48 (SPITBOL). Tier F + 5-line guard5 = regression-prevention floor for session #56. corpus has 32 new untracked files (132–147 .sno/.ref); csnobol4 has Makefile/README.md/findings.md changes. NO runtime source touched. Findings in `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session55-tier-f-findings.md`. Session #56 should implement STREXCCL with the 48-test gate.) **Session #56**: implemented STREXCCL in `isnobol4.c` (5 edits, ~50 lines): static descriptors + dispatch case 41 + L_STREXC handler + STARP6/DSARP2 PUSH(PDLPTR,YPTR) + STARP2 conditional install. **All floors preserved** (fence_function 10/10, Tier F 16/16, guard5 ✓) but **fence_suite did NOT improve**: same 43/3/2 as s52 alone. Trace evidence on test 114 (`STREXC_TRACE=1`) shows STREXCCL **does fire** but **PATBCL is already = inner-PATBCL** when walker reaches sentinel — refutes session #54's "leaked traps dispatched under wrong PATBCL" hypothesis. Some upstream handler sets PATBCL=inner during outer's failure walk before sentinel is reached. Saved as `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session56-strexccl-attempt.diff` (combined with s52, 90 lines self-contained against HEAD `1b2e28a`, verified to reproduce gates). **Session #57** should apply session #56 patch and add a PATBCL-write logger at every `D(PATBCL) = ...` site to find which write sets PATBCL=inner during outer walk — that's the upstream bug. Then either fix that write or augment STREXCCL with a paired BOTTOM-of-region sentinel. Findings in `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session56-findings.md`. csnobol4 working tree CLEAN at HEAD `1b2e28a`.) **Session #57**: applied s56 patch + instrumented all PATBCL touchpoints (3 D(PATBCL)= sites, 7 POP(PATBCL) sites, every SALT2 entry). Trace on test 119 **refutes both** session #54 (wrong-PATBCL-on-leaks) and session #56 (upstream-write-sets-PATBCL=inner). Decisive evidence: every PATBCL change in the run is accounted for; bug is **multi-iteration ARBNO leak class** — STREXCCL only protects most recent iteration; earlier ARBNO `*cmd` iterations left inner-pattern leaks below STREXCCL's reach. After STARP5 final POP restores PATBCL=outer, walker descends into iter#2's unprotected leaks at PDLPTR=0x...ae0 reading `{a=0x200, f=0, v=96}` under outer PATBCL → SCIN3 fallthrough → `D(outer + 0x200)` = garbage → ZCL=NULL → SEGV at isnobol4.c:11521. Three fix candidates documented: **(c)** persistent STREXCCL across iterations; **(b refined)** paired BOTTOM-sentinel; **(d)** PDL truncate + deferred-alt array. Diagnostic patch saved as `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session57-diagnostic.diff` (145 lines, env-gated `PATBCL_LOG=1`, reusable). Findings in `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session57-findings.md`. Working tree CLEAN at HEAD `273f5f3`. **Session #58** should read SPITBOL p_str/=ndexc/flpop carefully then implement (b/c/d).) **Session #58**: read SPITBOL p_exa/p_nth/p_exb/p_exc + p_aba/p_abb/p_abc/p_abd. Implemented paired top + bottom STREXCCL sentinels (s58 patch). **All 6 fence_suite CRASHes ELIMINATED** (44/4/0). fence_function 10/10 + Tier F 16/16 + guard5 preserved. Beauty 35→42 lines (first non-zero gain since session #45). Tests 119/129 went CRASH→FAIL (wrong-answer not crash). NOT committed (RULES.md). Saved as `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session58-paired-strexc-attempt.diff`. csnobol4 advanced to `68075bb` (docs only). **Session #59**: continued from s58; added SALT2-entry trace; test 119 produced only 7 events before "unexpected match". **Architectural diagnosis: CSNOBOL4 uses PATBCL+offset addressing while SPITBOL uses direct memory pointers — leaked inner SCIN3 entries become semantically wrong (not crashing) when read under outer PATBCL.** Two STREXBCL variants tested: FAIL-on-fire regressed 44/4/0→43/5/0; PATBCL=outer+continue identical to s58. **Two structural fix candidates: (a) PDLHED-bound SALT2 walker — mirror SPITBOL pmhbs; reuse existing PDLHED machinery; precedent at v311.sil:3975 (BAL walker); RECOMMENDED. (b) truncate-on-success with deferred-alts array — heavier.** Session #60 should implement (a). Findings in `csnobol4/docs/F-2-Step3a-session59-findings.md`. csnobol4 advanced to `1b59147`. |
| Icon Frontend Ladder | `GOAL-LANG-ICON.md` | one4all | IC-9 (session #20, 2026-04-30, one4all `2add5179`: closes the `?T` candidate flagged at end of session #19. Three correctness fixes in `src/driver/interp.c` (+81/-4): (1) **`E_RANDOM` (`?E`) handler added** to shared switch after E_NONNULL — was unhandled, fell through to `default → NULVCL` (same bug class as #19's `/E`/`\E`). Now dispatches by descriptor type: `DT_T` random entry value (fail if size=0), `DT_DATA` icnlist random elem (fail if empty), `IS_INT_fn` random `[1,n]` (fail if n≤0), `DT_SNUL` fail, string random char (fail if empty). Local static LCG (Knuth MMIX constants), self-contained — no cross-file linkage with frontend's `icn_random`. (2) **`image()` propagates FAILDESCR** — pre-fix `image(?T_empty)` reached string branch, returned quoted empty string. One-line guard added. (3) **`write()`/`writes()` evaluate all args before any output** — pre-fix evaluated and printf-ed incrementally, so `writes("x", fail())` printed "x" before failing. Now buffers all values into GC_malloc'd DESCR_t array first; only outputs on all-success. Per-test diff for rung36_jcon_table lines 1–3 now match expected (`should fail "" >>` → ` >>`; `>> 3 &null` → `>> 3 3`). Verified on /tmp/test_random.icn — 9/9 cases correct across int/string/table/list. All gates baseline: smoke 5/0, broker 49/0, crosscheck 4/0, all-rungs 188/45/30/263, rung36 5/40/30/75 (no PASS-count movement — affected rung36 tests stay .xfail per #18/#19 pattern). Working-tree pollution `foo.baz` cleaned again (per RULES.md; same as #19 cleanup). **Next pivot:** the remaining four table-touch failures all share a single shape — lvalue position needs a generator-aware path (`every !x := V` / `every x[key(x)] := V` / `every x[3] <- 19` / `every !x +:= 20`). One well-placed fix in `interp_eval_ref` likely closes 2–3 at once. Separately: `delete()` arity bug (1-arg `delete(x)` and 3-arg `delete(x,3,6)` silently fail to delete; visible as `delete : 4` vs expected `delete : 2`) — lower leverage, cheap, isolated.) |
| Prolog Frontend Ladder | `GOAL-LANG-PROLOG.md` | one4all | PL-12 (session 2026-04-30 #6: Fix #2 v3 implemented and proven mechanically correct, but **NOT COMMITTED** — exposing real var-goal dispatch breaks 36 plunit suites previously passing on silent-success default arm. Per RULES.md regression-in-error-class. v3 bridge: `pl_term_to_synth_expr` walks Term recursively producing EXPR with E_VAR slots holding original Term*s (deduped by pointer identity), then `pl_invoke_var_goal` dispatches via direct `interp_exec_pl_builtin` recursion (NOT `pl_box_goal_from_ir + bb_broker` like session #4 — simpler, avoids choice-point complexity for catch's once-shot semantics). All 3 session #4 primary repros now pass: `G=fail` catch → failed ✅; `G=(X=5)` catch → [ok,5] ✅; `G=(A is 3+4)` catch → [ok,7] ✅. **Decisive bridge-correctness proof:** with locally-defined memberchk, `G = memberchk(f(X,a), [f(x,b), f(y,a)]), catch(G,_,fail), write([ok,X])` outputs `[ok,y]` — bindings flow end-to-end through TT_REF chains. **Session #4's hypothesised "asserted-clause cenv lifecycle" bug DOES NOT EXIST.** Real cause of suite collapse: corpus `plunit.pl` is missing ~25 stdlib predicates (memberchk, length, between, false, term_variables, numbervars/4, format/3, string_*/N, etc.) that the silent-success default was masking. Baseline 43/57 was a false-positive ceiling. **NEW 2-step path to gate (supersedes session #4's plan):** Step A — enrich corpus `plunit.pl` with ~25 stdlib predicates; re-measure baseline (likely 50+/57). Step B — re-apply v3 bridge from `docs/PL-12-session-2026-04-30-6-attempt.diff` (211 lines preserved); expected ≥80% gate. Step A MUST precede Step B. v3 NOT yet wired into `\+`/`once`/`not` (same defect pattern, deferred until Step A done). Smoke 5/5, broker 49/49, SWI 43/57 unchanged at session-end (working tree reverted to one4all 84e72705 HEAD).) |

Lon's session-#80 minor edits to `claws5.sc`, `treebank-list.sc`, `treebank-array.sc` verified — treebank-list.sc preserved at PASS in all 3 modes; claws5.sc remains byte-identical to claws5.sno SPITBOL on both inputs (SB-5c.2 corpus-curation issue unchanged). Three baseline gates green PASS=5/PASS=42 SKIP=3/PASS=49; crosscheck snobol4=6, snocone=8 unchanged. SB-6.D investigation snapshot: `EVAL(EXPRESSION)` is no-op at beauty.sc's Reduce call site (1st EVAL returns same EXPRESSION descriptor; 2nd EVAL produces correct STRING `''` failure). Standalone `/tmp/repro2.sc` (omega-string-EVAL pattern matching semantic.sc::reduce shape) does NOT reproduce — first EVAL works correctly there. Bug requires the wrapped context (`nPush() && X4 && reduce(...) && nPop()` like Expr4 line 69 of beauty.sc); EXPRESSION descriptor at Reduce call site appears double-wrapped. **Session #82 next steps:** (1) run `/tmp/repro3.sc` to confirm wrapper exposes double-wrap; (2) SPITBOL cross-check on SNOBOL4-equivalent reproducer; (3) if confirmed, fix in `src/runtime/x86/snobol4_invoke.c` or EVAL/EXPRESSION descriptor packing path. corpus dirty (3 .sc); .github dirty (this update + goal file s#81 narrative); one4all/csnobol4/x64 clean.) |
| **Snocone Language: Space-Concat** | `GOAL-SNOCONE-LANG-SPACE.md` | one4all+corpus | LS-4.h IN-PROGRESS (session 2026-04-30 #11: LS-4.g LANDED — do/while, do/until, for. 596/596 parse gates. Next: function/return/freturn/nreturn.) | parse-f 118/118 PASS in working tree, one4all `c4337189`. Implementation complete: balanced matched_stmt/unmatched_stmt grammar, emit-and-splice architecture (snapshot tail in if_head/while_head, finalize-and-splice in parent action — avoids the 96 reduce/reduce conflicts of the eager-emit-via-MRA approach Bison kills counterexample-generation on). `else_keyword` shares one non-terminal across matched/unmatched if-else rules. `opt_head_sep` absorbs the spurious T_CONCAT the W{OP}W lexer emits between `)` of an if/while head and a value-starting body token. Combined parse gates 488/488 (was 370/370). All production gates green: smoke 5/5, beauty 42/0/3, broker 49/0. **HELD OPEN pending Lon decision**: does `if (c) {...}` (bare bound name) lower to same shape as `if (DIFFER(c)) {...}`? Today's lowering accepts bare-name and emits :F(Lend) that can never fire (runtime-correct, IR-misleading). Three options: (1) accept as-is, document gotcha; (2) restrict cond to operator-yielding exprs at parse time; (3) auto-wrap bare-name as DIFFER. All mechanical from this checkpoint.

Trace at ec=2840 showed *upr (UnevaluatedPattern node=5) being re-entered after the graft succeeds. Root cause: BetaStack is shared across PatternMatch invocations; nested PatternMatch (via $ *fn(...) immediate-assignment calling match() which runs its own ?) iterates the outer BetaStack in its commit loop, causing spurious extra function calls.

## Architecture (one paragraph)

Every frontend (SNOBOL4, Icon, Prolog, Snocone, Rebus, Scrip) produces the shared IR.
SM-LOWER compiles IR to SM_Program — a flat array of stack machine instructions.
The INTERP executes SM_Program. The EMITTER walks SM_Program and emits native code
(x86, JVM, .NET, JS, WASM). Interpreter and emitter share one instruction set.
