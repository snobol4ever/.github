# GOAL-LANG-PROLOG.md — Prolog Frontend Ladder

**Repo:** one4all
**Done when:** SWI-Prolog conformance suite and GNU Prolog test suite pass
under all three modes (--ir-run, --sm-run, --jit-run). Dynamic predicates,
exceptions, DCG, and arithmetic extensions complete.

**Cross-pollination:** pl_runtime.c fixes (trail, unify, pred table) benefit
interp.c's E_CHOICE/E_CLAUSE/E_UNIFY handling shared with all frontends.
BB broker improvements (BB_ONCE, pl_box_choice) benefit SNOBOL4 alternation.
Share fixes via main — no branches.

## Test suite install scripts (write these at PL-1)

### install_swi_prolog_tests.sh
Fetches the SWI-Prolog ISO conformance tests from:
  https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/tree/master/src/Tests/core
Target dir: `/home/claude/corpus/programs/prolog/swi_tests/`
Tests to include: `arithmetic.pl`, `atom.pl`, `control.pl`, `findall.pl`,
`list.pl`, `meta.pl`, `strings.pl`, `terms.pl`, `exceptions.pl`.
Oracle: run each test under SWI-Prolog (`swipl`) if installed, else use
pre-baked `.ref` files in the corpus.

### install_gnu_prolog_tests.sh
Fetches the GNU Prolog test suite from:
  https://github.com/didoudiaz/gprolog/tree/master/src/TestsPl
Target dir: `/home/claude/corpus/programs/prolog/gnu_tests/`
Tests: `t_arith.pl`, `t_atom.pl`, `t_control.pl`, `t_dcg.pl`, `t_list.pl`.

Both scripts are idempotent. If corpus already present, skip clone. Print SKIP.

## Architecture reminder

```
.pl → prolog_compile() → Program* [LANG_PL]
    --ir-run  → execute_program() → interp_eval() E_CHOICE/E_CLAUSE/E_UNIFY
    --sm-run  → sm_lower() → SM_BB_ONCE per stmt → bb_broker(BB_ONCE)
    --jit-run → sm_lower() → SM_BB_ONCE → sm_codegen() → sm_jit_run()

Backtracking: BB_ONCE mode — pl_box_choice is the OR-box.
Trail: g_pl_trail (global in pl_runtime.c).
Pred table: g_pl_pred_table (global in pl_runtime.c).
```

## Current state (2026-04-15, one4all HEAD ea80bd8d, corpus HEAD e587489)

PL-1 through PL-11 fully done. PL-12 IN PROGRESS.

PL-12 work done this session:
- build_scrip.sh: SKIP-if-exists guard removed (always runs make). DONE.
- pl_runtime.c: directive no-ops added (dynamic, module, use_module, include,
  discontiguous, style_check, if/endif, etc.) so SWI test directives don't
  crash. DONE.
- pl_runtime.c: user-call dispatch added at top of E_FNC in
  interp_exec_pl_builtin — routes user predicates via interp_eval before
  builtin fallthrough. Expanded is_pl_user_call builtins list. DONE.
- test_prolog_swi_suite.sh: corpus-repo path fixed to corpus; loop uses
  test_*_main.pl wrappers; passes plunit.pl+testfile+main to scrip. DONE.
- corpus/plunit.pl: fully rewritten (136 lines). Multi-clause cut-based
  dispatch; findall-based test collection (no fail-loop); pj_run_* naming.
  DONE but BLOCKER remains (see below).

BLOCKER: -> (if-then) operator fails silently inside single-clause user
predicates when called cross-file via interp_eval/BB_ONCE.
  Symptom: ( SF =:= 0 -> format('PASS ~w~n',[Suite]) ; format('FAIL ...') )
  inside pj_suite_verdict produces NO output at all.
  Root cause hypothesis: interp_exec_pl_builtin is called with wrong env
  pointer when dispatching -> from inside a clause body executed by
  bb_broker. The -> cond check calls interp_exec_pl_builtin(cond, env)
  where env is the clause arg array — but =:=/2 or format/2 may be
  mis-evaluating the args.
  Minimal repro: foo :- nb_setval(x,0), nb_getval(x,V),
                        ( V =:= 0 -> writeln(ok) ; writeln(fail) ).
                 main :- foo.
  Test this in isolation first.

NEXT SESSION PL-12:
  1. Run minimal repro above to confirm -> bug.
  2. In interp_exec_pl_builtin, trace the ; -> branch:
     left->children[0] is V =:= 0, left->children[1] is writeln(ok).
     Check that pl_unified_term_from_expr(V, env) resolves V correctly
     when env is the clause's arg array vs NULL.
  3. Fix: likely need to thread g_pl_env (global) through instead of
     local env param, or unify env with g_pl_env before calling.
  4. Once -> fixed: run test_prolog_swi_suite.sh, gate >= 80%.

## --monitor: in-process sync comparator (IM-7/IM-8 complete)

`--monitor` runs IR, SM, and JIT step-by-step over the same program,
snapshot/restoring all mutable state between runs, and reports the first
statement where any two executors diverge.

```bash
./scrip --monitor file.sno    # SNOBOL4
./scrip --monitor file.icn    # Icon
./scrip --monitor file.pl     # Prolog
./scrip --monitor file.raku   # Raku
./scrip --monitor file.snc    # Snocone
./scrip --monitor file.reb    # Rebus
```

**On agreement:** prints per-stmt progress, exits 0.
**On divergence:** exits 1 and prints:
```
DIVERGE at stmt N [label: LABEL, line LL]
  IR   last_ok=?
  SM   last_ok=1
  JIT  last_ok=1
  IR vs SM (N var(s) differ):
    VARNAME    IR=<value>    SM=<value>
```

**Workflow for finding bugs:**
1. Run `./scrip --monitor suspect.sno` to find the first diverging statement.
2. The statement number + variable name pinpoint the root cause.
3. Fix in the appropriate layer (interp.c for IR bugs, sm_interp.c or
   sm_codegen.c for SM/JIT bugs).
4. Re-run `--monitor` to confirm divergence is gone.
5. Run `test_smoke_unified_broker.sh` — must stay PASS=31 FAIL=0.

**Note:** `--monitor` is incompatible with `--ir-run`/`--sm-run`/`--jit-run`
(it drives all three internally). ICN frame locals (IM-10) and Prolog trail
variables (IM-11) are not yet in the snapshot — coming in future IM steps.

## Current state (2026-04-16, one4all HEAD 372f5309)

PL-1 through PL-11 fully done. PL-12 IN PROGRESS — 71% coverage.

Session 2026-04-16 work:
- Makefile: removed stale engine.c reference (deleted SN-6, Makefile not updated;
  broke build at session start). DONE.
- corpus repo cloned (/home/claude/corpus).
- Diagnosed ->  blocker from previous session: already resolved in current build.
- Diagnosed 0% SWI suite coverage: root cause was cut scoping bug (see below).
- pl_broker.c: rewrote cut scoping — per-OR-box cut field + g_pl_cur_cut_flag ptr.
  Before: g_pl_cut_flag was global; ! inside pj_run_one/4 leaked to parent
  pj_run_tests/2 OR-box, aborting all tests after the first silently.
  After: each pl_choice_t has own cut field; pl_cut_fn signals through
  g_pl_cur_cut_flag (always points to innermost OR-box); save/restore on entry/exit.
  Standard Prolog cut scoping: cut terminates exactly the predicate containing it.
- SWI suite: 0% -> 71% (PASS=41 FAIL=16 TOTAL=57).
  Fully passing: test_exception, test_list, test_misc.
  Remaining 16 failures: rem, float_zero, bips, arg, length, snip, phrase,
  steadfastness, context, string, string_bytes, term_singletons, and others.

NEXT SESSION PL-12:
  Gate target: >= 80% (need 46/57).
  Currently at 41/57 — need 5 more passing suites.
  Approach: run suite with raw output, identify first 5 failing suites,
  fix builtins/semantics causing those failures one at a time.
  Start with: rem (modulo), arg/2, length/2, snip (cut-in-if-then), phrase/2.

## Current state (2026-04-15, one4all HEAD f33686e9, corpus HEAD e587489)

PL-1 through PL-11 fully done. PL-12 IN PROGRESS — 71% coverage. Baseline unchanged.

Session 2026-04-15 work (this session — diagnosis only, no net commit to one4all):

### Root cause diagnosed: catch(Var, _, Recovery) bug

`catch(Goal, _, Recovery)` where `Goal` is an E_VAR (Prolog variable bound at
runtime to an atom like `fail`) always succeeds instead of propagating Goal's
failure. Root cause: in the `!threw` branch of catch/3 in pl_runtime.c, when
`goal_e->kind == E_VAR`, the code falls through to
`interp_exec_pl_builtin(goal_e, env)`. That function's `switch(goal->kind)`
has no E_VAR case, hits `default: return 1` — always success regardless of
what Goal is bound to.

Confirmed minimal repro:
```prolog
wrapper(Goal) :- catch(Goal, _, true), !, writeln(first_clause).
wrapper(_)    :- writeln(second_clause).
main :- wrapper(fail).
% Expected: second_clause   Actual (buggy): first_clause
```

This is why arg:zero / arg:two / arg:big / snip all fail: plunit's
`pj_do_fail(Suite, Name, Goal)` uses exactly this two-clause cut pattern with
`catch(Goal, _, true)`.

### Fix approach (NOT yet committed — regression discovered):

Added `pl_invoke_term(Term *t, Term **env)` to dereference a runtime Term and
call it as a goal. Wired into catch/3 E_VAR branch. Fix is structurally
correct BUT causes regressions in arg:unify, arg:one, bips_occurs_check_error
because `pl_invoke_term` for user-pred calls passes `term_deref(args[i])` as
uenv — raw dereferenced pointers instead of fresh trail-linked var cells that
interp_eval expects. The deep-copy alternative also breaks trailing.

### NEXT SESSION PL-12 fix plan:

1. In pl_runtime.c catch/3 E_VAR branch, add:
   ```c
   if (goal_e->kind == E_VAR) {
       Term *gt = pl_unified_term_from_expr(goal_e, env);
       ok = pl_invoke_term(gt, env);
   } else if (is_pl_user_call(goal_e)) { ...
   ```

2. In pl_invoke_term compound branch, for user-pred calls:
   DO NOT pass raw term_deref(args[i]) or deep copies.
   Instead allocate fresh var cells and UNIFY them with the args:
   ```c
   Term **uenv = pl_env_new(arity);
   Trail *trail = &g_pl_trail;
   for (int i = 0; i < arity; i++) {
       int mark = trail_mark(trail);
       unify(uenv[i], t->compound.args[i], trail);
       // don't unwind — keep bindings
   }
   ```
   This preserves trailing so interp_eval sees properly linked vars.

3. Also handle atom goals that are user-defined 0-arity predicates.

4. Gate: suite must stay at 71% with fix, THEN arg:zero/two/big pass → net gain.

5. After arg fixed, address: snip (cut-in-if-then), bips errors, length/2,
   rem:allq (maplist-as-generator), phrase/2, string/string_bytes.

NEXT SESSION starts at step 1 above. DO NOT re-diagnose — go straight to fix.

---

## Current state (2026-04-16 session 2, one4all HEAD f33686e9, corpus HEAD e587489)

PL-12 IN PROGRESS — 71% (41/57). Baseline unchanged from previous session.

### Key findings this session

**The 71% baseline is partially vacuous.**
test_exception / test_list / test_misc pass with ZERO tests actually executed
(the test/2 clauses are loaded but collection via findall produces empty list
due to an OR-box crash when test(N,Opts) is called with two unbound vars on
multi-clause predicates with complex head patterns). These three suites "pass"
only because no tests run and plunit prints PASS vacuously.

**test_call, test_arith, test_term, test_dcg DO run real tests.**

### Actual real per-suite status (what scrip currently produces vs .ref):

| Suite | Actual | Ref | Delta |
|-------|--------|-----|-------|
| test_arith | rem FAIL, float_zero FAIL, float_special FAIL, moded_int FAIL | all PASS except float_compare | -4 |
| test_bips | DUPLICATED OUTPUT (runs twice) | PASS bips/arg/eq/length/is_most_general_term | broken |
| test_call | snip FAIL | all PASS | -1 |
| test_dcg | phrase FAIL, steadfastness FAIL, context FAIL | all PASS | -3 |
| test_exception | PASS throw, PASS ex_coroutining (vacuous) | same | = |
| test_list | PASS memberchk (vacuous) | same | = |
| test_misc | PASS misc (vacuous) | same | = |
| test_string | NO OUTPUT | PASS string, PASS string_bytes | -2 |
| test_term | term_singletons FAIL | PASS | -1 |

### Root cause: test_bips duplication
test_bips_main.pl does `:- include('test_bips.pl')` but the suite script
already passes test_bips.pl as a separate file. The test module is loaded
twice, running all suites twice. Fix: remove the include from _main.pl OR
make the suite script not pass the .pl separately.

### catch(Var,_,Recovery) bug — still present, fix approach validated
The E_VAR fix (pl_invoke_term) is structurally correct and passes the
minimal repro. It doesn't cause regressions by itself — the regression
seen earlier was caused by combining E_VAR fix with deep-copy of args.
The correct fix (fresh vars + unify via trail) needs one more iteration.
This fix will unblock: arg:zero/two/big, snip (via pj_do_fail), and
any other test using the two-clause cut pattern in plunit.

### NEXT SESSION PL-12 — ordered task list:

1. **Fix test_bips_main.pl** — remove `:- include('test_bips.pl').` line.
   Commit to corpus repo. This stops double-run.

2. **Fix test_string no-output** — run test_string manually, diagnose.
   Likely string builtins (string_to_atom, atom_string, etc.) missing.

3. **Apply catch(Var,_,Recovery) fix** — surgical, in pl_runtime.c:
   a. Add pl_invoke_term(Term *t) before interp_exec_pl_builtin.
   b. For user-pred compound calls: pl_env_new(arity), then for each i:
      unify(uenv[i], t->compound.args[i], trail) — keep binding, no unwind.
   c. In catch/3 !threw branch: if (goal_e->kind == E_VAR) { gt = pl_unified_term_from_expr(goal_e,env); ok = pl_invoke_term(gt); }
   d. Verify suite stays >= 71%. arg:zero/two/big should now pass.

4. **Fix snip** — cut inside if-then. One test in test_call.

5. **Fix steadfastness/context** — DCG tests. Investigate phrase/2 first.

6. **Fix rem:allq** — maplist(between(-50,50),[X,Y]) as backtracking generator.
   Our maplist only verifies, doesn't generate. Add generating path.

7. **Fix term_singletons** — inspect what term_singletons/2 does, implement.

Gate: >= 80% (46/57). Currently 41. Need 5 more.
Quickest path: fix test_bips (+5 suites if duplication resolved and
bips/arg/length/eq/is_most_general_term pass) or fix catch bug (+arg suite).
