## ⛔ MODE PRIORITY (Lon, 2026-05-26) — MODE 2 then 3; MODE 4 DEFERRED

Get correctness in **mode 2 (`--interp`)** first, then **mode 3 (`--run`, in-proc)**. **Mode 4
(`--compile`) is DEFERRED until further notice** — it is the slowest to iterate (emit asm → gcc -c →
link libscrip_rt → run) and should not gate generator/AG work. Bring constructs up in 2→3 order;
mode 4 follows for free once 3 is flat-wired (mode 3 ≡ mode 4 x86, differing only in process
boundary). Do NOT spend a session round-tripping mode-4 binaries while mode 2/3 still have gaps.

---

## ⛔⛔ NEXT SESSION — START HERE. FIRST RUNG, FIRST STEP. (added 2026-05-27e, Opus 4.7)

**RUNG ICN-Z-ATOMIC — wholesale conversion of operand-bearing composites to 4-port threaded form,
ONE pass. Do this FIRST, the moment the session opens. Fresh context required (~80%+); the surface
is ~68 `lower_icn_expr_node` sites + ~11 `bb_exec.c` composite cases + a storage-convention change.**

### Why wholesale, NOT incremental (read once)
`bb_exec_node` is a SHARED driver. Today's composite cases (BB_BINOP line 677, BB_BINOP_GEN 693,
BB_CALL 54/478, BB_ASSIGN 422, BB_IF 827, BB_CONJ 854, BB_EVERY 871, BB_ALT 988, BB_TO_BY 1041,
BB_TO 1954) all treat `nd->α` and `nd->β` as **operand-child pointers** — the operand SUBTREES are
stored in α/β and reached by recursive `bb_exec_node(nd->α)`. Convert ONE construct's α/β to be a
control-flow port while its siblings keep operand-child semantics → the shared driver cannot
distinguish "recurse this child" from "follow this port," because both are `BB_t*`. Hybrid breaks.
Either all composites use α/β as ports, or none do. 100 small-rung iterations cannot reach a
self-consistent state — only a wholesale change can.

### The storage convention (the structural insight — read twice)
JCON's irgen does NOT have an operand-child relation. Every operand chunk is a peer in the chunk
list, glued by `ir_Goto`. The 4 ports of a binop in irgen are LABELS on the parent's chunk; the
operand subtrees are reached by `Goto` to their `.start`. `BB.h`'s GOLDEN BB RULE comment forbids
adding `lhs/rhs/c[]/n` to `BB_t` ("DO NOT add c[], n, lhs, rhs, operand..."). So the conversion is:
stop storing operand subtrees in `BB_t.α/β`. Build operands as separate `BB_t` nodes in the SAME
`cfg->all[]` pool. Parent's `α`/`β` become PURE CONTROL-FLOW PORTS (continuation labels). Operand
graphs are reached the same way JCON reaches them: by Goto from the parent's α-chunk to the
operand's α, and the operand's γ/ω fold back into the parent's next-port continuation. The graph
of α-entries and γ/ω-continuations forms the runtime CFG; there is no operand-child tree.

The runtime payload for the operand binding is the operand's `value` field (the result the parent
reads after the operand's γ port fires). `bb_exec.c` becomes a pure port-follower: dispatch on `nd`,
write `nd->value`, return the next port. NO `bb_exec_node(nd->α)` recursive call anywhere.

### EXACT STEPS (do in order, gate after EACH group)

**Step 1 — Read the AG (no code yet).** Open `/home/claude/jcon/jcon-master/tran/irgen.icn` (cloned
from the JCON master in HANDOFF-2026-05-27-OPUS-ICON-BB-ICN-Z-2B context) and read these procedures
in full: `ir_a_Binop` (472), `ir_binary` (430), `ir_a_Call` (360), `ir_a_If` (577), `ir_a_Every`
(309), `ir_a_Alt` (167), `ir_a_ToBy` (1168), `ir_conjunction` (405), `ir_a_Compound` (1231),
`ir_a_ProcBody` (774), and `ir_init` (1426). Build the port-wiring table on paper before touching C.

**Step 2 — Storage convention.** In `lower_icn.c`, change every `lower_icn_*` builder that today
sets `nd->α = lhs_subtree` / `nd->β = rhs_subtree` to instead: (a) allocate the operand subtrees as
PEER `BB_t` nodes via `BB_node_alloc`, (b) thread `nd->α` to the lhs-operand's `α` (its start), (c)
wire lhs-operand's `γ` to the rhs-operand's `α` (or to a synthesized "after-lhs" continuation that
caches `lhs->value`), (d) rhs-operand's `γ` to the parent's apply-chunk, which writes `nd->value`
and returns `nd->γ`. Failure ports fold to `nd->ω`. Mirror `ir_a_Binop` exactly — DO NOT invent.

**Step 3 — bb_exec.c.** Delete the operand recursion in every composite case. Each case becomes:
read `nd->value` (already set by the predecessor port-firing), apply the per-kind operation if any,
write the result to `nd->value`, return the appropriate port. NO `bb_exec_node(nd->α)` calls. The
driver is now a pure port-follower: `while (nd) { nd = bb_exec_node(nd); }`.

**Step 4 — Gate ALL of these after each construct family lands, NOT after each site:**
- `bash scripts/test_smoke_icon.sh` PASS=5
- `bash scripts/test_icon_all_rungs.sh` PASS ≥ 198 (target: monotonic increase)
- `bash scripts/test_smoke_prolog.sh` PASS=5
- `bash scripts/test_smoke_unified_broker.sh` PASS ≥ 23
- `grep -rnE 'seg_byte\(SEG_|SL_B\(|sl_emit_one|emit_standard_blob|bake_blob_call' src/ | grep -v _templates/ | grep -v emit_core | wc -l` == 0
- Sanity: `printf 'procedure main()\n write("a")\n write("b")\nend\n' | ./scrip --interp /dev/stdin` MUST print `a\nb\n` (today prints only `a` — this is the litmus for the whole rung)

**Step 5 — Construct families, do in THIS order (each is one gate cycle):**
1. **BB_ASSIGN** (simplest non-leaf with 1 operand subtree — `target := value`). Bridge from leaf.
2. **BB_CALL** (the multi-write blocker). Operands are the argument list; gluing each arg's γ to
   the next arg's α, last arg's γ to the call's apply chunk, all ω to the call's ω.
3. **BB_BINOP** (2 operand subtrees, well-known shape; irgen `ir_binary`).
4. **BB_IF** (note: `ir_a_If` — condition's success→then.α, failure→else.α; then/else γ both →
   parent.γ, ω → parent.ω). `icn_kind_owns_omega_operand` retires when IF stops using ω as operand.
5. **BB_CONJ** (`ir_conjunction` — e1.γ→e2.α; e2.γ→parent.γ; e1.ω→parent.ω; e2.ω→e1.β).
6. **BB_ALT** (`ir_a_Alt` — e1.γ→parent.γ; e1.ω→e2.α; e2.γ→parent.γ; e2.ω→parent.ω; β→e1.β
   for re-entry).
7. **BB_EVERY** / **BB_TO** / **BB_TO_BY** / **BB_BINOP_GEN** (generator kinds — read `ir_a_Every`
   and `ir_a_ToBy`; resumable β=self stays per `icn_kind_is_resumable`).

**Step 6 — Retirements.** When step 5.4 lands, delete `icn_kind_owns_omega_operand` (and its
forward declaration added by ICN-Z-2b) — IF no longer owns ω as operand. The BB_IF guard in
ICN-Z-2b's `lower_icn_proc_body` post-pass and in BB_SEQ's port-follower can both go.

### DO NOT, this rung
- Do NOT touch SNOBOL4 / Snocone / Rebus / Raku BB families (different ports/semantics).
- Do NOT touch BB_PAT_* or pattern-matching (different driver).
- Do NOT add `lhs/rhs/c[]/n` to `BB_t` — the GOLDEN BB RULE forbids it; operands are PEERS not
  children.
- Do NOT half-zip across step 5's families. Either a family is fully converted and green, or it is
  not started this session.

### Acceptance — the rung is done when:
1. The 6-gate set in step 4 is green AND the multi-write sanity passes (`a\nb` not just `a`).
2. `grep -rnE 'bb_exec_node\(nd->[αβ]\)' src/lower/bb_exec.c | wc -l` == 0 (no operand recursion).
3. `icn_kind_owns_omega_operand` removed.
4. rungs PASS ≥ 198 holds; ideally rises (more multi-stmt programs now work).

⛔ **SESSION 2026-05-27c (Opus 4.7) — ICN-XA-1 LANDED + the `lt`/`mult`/`compound` mode-4 FAILs FIXED. mode4_rung PASS=2→5 FAIL=0.**

**KEY CORRECTION to the prior watermark's BINOP_GEN target.** The prior "sharper target" assumed
mode-4 routed `mult`/`lt`/`compound` through `bb_binop_gen.cpp` and only needed a template fill. Tracing
the ACTUAL mode-4 lowering showed it did NOT: `lower_mul`/`lower_acomp` (lower.c) emitted a FLAT SM
scaffold (`SM_BB_SWITCH; SM_BB_SWITCH; SM_MUL`) — TWO independent `BB_TO` graphs with no cross-product
driver between them. The single every-loop back-edge re-drives only the first switch → wrong output.
`bb_binop_gen.cpp` was NEVER reached in mode-4 for these programs. So the gate-movers needed BOTH a
lowering change AND the template fill — not template-only.

**DONE (real, verified, non-regressing):**
1. **ICN-XA-1 `walk_bb_node_str_c`** (emit_core.c/.h): `BB_t* → char*` variant — swaps the shared
   emit sink to an `open_memstream` FILE* around the EXISTING `walk_bb_node` dispatch, restores after.
   NOT a second producer: every byte still originates in the keyed template fns (FACT RULE grep 0).
   `sm_bb_switch.cpp` ICN_GEN arm rewired to `pre + walk_bb_node_str_c(gen) + post` — the LOCAL-PURGE
   violation (`emit_text_n` + `walk_bb_node` mid-`_str()`) is GONE; the arm is now pure.
2. **Generator-binop routing** (lower.c): `lower_add/sub/mul/div/mod/acomp` now call
   `lower_icn_gen_binop(t)` first — if an operand is suspendable, register the WHOLE binop subtree as
   ONE BB graph (`lower_icn_expr_top` builds BB_BINOP_GEN w/ α=lhs β=rhs operand boxes) and emit a
   SINGLE `SM_BB_SWITCH` (exactly like `lower_to`). Mode-4 now routes through `bb_binop_gen.cpp`.
3. **`bb_binop_gen.cpp` real odometer** (TEXT/mode-4): inline x86 cross-product mirroring `bb_exec.c`
   BB_BINOP_GEN (688-762). Seeds outer (lhs) + inner (rhs); on β advances inner, on inner-exhaust
   advances outer + re-seeds inner; applies via `rt_arith` (arith) / `rt_acomp`+`rt_last_ok` (relop,
   with relop-fail retry); outer-exhaust → ω. Operand boxes emitted INLINE: generators via
   `walk_bb_node_str_c`, BB_LIT_I single-shot via `synth_single_shot_box`. DESCR_t pop reads union
   `.i` from **rdx** (16-byte struct SysV ABI — `v|slen`→rax, union→rdx; the all-`36` bug was reading
   rax). Nested BINOP_GEN (compound) works: non-static child labels avoid reentrancy aliasing.

**GATES: smoke_icon 5/5 · broker 23 · icon_all_rungs 198 · smoke_prolog 5/5 (ALL unchanged) ·
mode4_rung PASS=5 FAIL=0 (was 2/3) · FACT RULE grep 0.** `lt`→`3,4`; `mult`→`1,2,2,4,3,6`;
`compound`→`4,6` — all byte-exact vs `--interp`.

**ICN-M4 follow-on (documented, not blocking):** `synth_single_shot_box` handles BB_LIT_I only; BB_VAR
/BB_KEYWORD/non-int-literal single-shot operands fall to a `[non-gen … inline TODO]` port-stub (jmp ω).
DT_I round-trip in the apply path assumes integer operand generators (true for the gate seed set);
real/string operand values need a descr-preserving holding cell. BINARY (mode-3 brokered) arm is still
the α→γ/β→ω passthrough stub — mode-4 TEXT is the gate path per the MODE-PRIORITY directive.

⛔ **SESSION 2026-05-27b (Opus 4.7) — ICN-Z-0 + ICN-Z-1 landed; ICN-Z-2 substantial; ICN-Z-3 found BLOCKED.**
ICN-Z-0: `icn_leaf(nd, γ_in, ω_in, &α_out, &β_out, bounded)` + bounded-aware
`lower_icn_expr_threaded_b` (both exported). Bounded rule mirrors irgen + lower_pl.c:
`β=(!bounded && icn_kind_is_resumable) ? self : ω_in`. ICN-Z-1: `icn_tree_is_leaf` classifier;
leaves seed `bounded=1` forced, decoupling leaf β=ω from the resumable table. ICN-Z-2 substantial:
proc-body statement chain lowers `bounded=1` + `bb_exec.c` BB_SEQ already walks the γ-chain forward
(non-backtracking advance per ir_a_Compound); remaining = explicit ω→next.α port wire for mode-3/4.
ALL gates non-regressing: smoke_icon 5/5, broker 23, icon_all_rungs 198, smoke_prolog 5/5,
mode4_rung PASS=2, FACT-RULE grep 0.

⚡ **KEY FINDING — the mode-4 `lt`/`mult`/`compound` FAILs are gated on the FULL ICN-Z pass, not on
any single rung or template.** Verified three ways this session: (1) **Scaffold:** mode-2 passes only
via `SM_BB_PUMP_PROC` (C graph-walk that nests generators); mode-4 runs the flat SM scaffold whose
`SM_JUMP` back-edge re-drives only the innermost generator (emits `2,4,6` not the cross-product).
(2) **Template:** `bb_binop_gen.cpp` is a port-wired stub (α→γ, β→ω; real odometer marked
`TODO(mode-4)`). (3) **BB_CONJ (ICN-Z-3):** isolated rewire blocked by FINAL `BB_t` + operand-bearing
α/β.

⚡⚡ **CORRECTION + SHARPER TARGET (2026-05-27b, Opus 4.7 — supersedes the BINOP_GEN half of the
finding above).** Re-checked the lowering: for `(1 to 3)*(1 to 2)` the BINOP_GEN node holds its TWO
operand generators DIRECTLY — `nd->α` = the `1 to 3` BB_TO box, `nd->β` = the `1 to 2` BB_TO box
(lower_icn.c:513-514). They ARE reachable from `bb_binop_gen(nd)` at emit time; the emitter walks the
graph. So `mult`/`lt`/`compound` are NOT blocked on the driver/scaffold — they are a **template-only**
fix: make `bb_binop_gen.cpp` emit the cross-product odometer inline, recursively emitting its α and β
operand boxes via the same inline-walk `sm_bb_switch.cpp` uses (set `g_emit.lbl_α/β/γ/ω`, then
`walk_bb_node`). The odometer oracle is `bb_exec.c` BB_BINOP_GEN (677-743): seed both on α; on β
advance inner (β), on inner-exhaust reset inner.state=0 + advance outer (α); on relop-fail retry the
loop; outer-exhaust → ω.
**THE ONE REAL PREREQUISITE is ICN-XA-1's `walk_bb_node_str` (a `BB_t* → std::string` variant of
`walk_bb_node`, which currently writes only to `FILE*`).** Without it, a parent template that emits
child boxes inline must interleave `emit_text_n(...)` + `walk_bb_node(...)` mid-body — exactly the
LOCAL-PURGE / template-purity violation ICN-XA-1 names (sm_bb_switch.cpp:78 does this; do NOT copy it
into a clean BB template). **Next-session plan, small + template-only: (a) ICN-XA-1 — add
`walk_bb_node_str` (refactor emit_core.c:476 `walk_bb_node` to build a string via open_memstream or a
string sink, with the FILE* version a thin wrapper); (b) fill `bb_binop_gen.cpp` odometer using it; (c)
gate climbs mode4_rung PASS=2→5.** This is far smaller than the driver rewrite the ICN-Z-3 finding
implied for the conjunction case — CONJ still needs the full pass, but the gate-moving binop cases do
NOT.

⛔ **SESSION 2026-05-27b (Opus 4.7) — ICN-Z-0 + ICN-Z-1 landed; ICN-Z-2 substantial; ICN-Z-3 BLOCKED finding; BINOP_GEN target corrected.**

## ⚡ PRIOR WATERMARK (one4all `3a522bd8` — pushed 2026-05-27, Opus 4.7 session; rebased onto upstream Prolog AGW-9A `701403cb`)

GATES: smoke_icon **5/5** ✅ · broker **23** · icon_all_rungs **198** ✅ · smoke_prolog **5/5** ✅
(2026-05-26, Opus 4.7: every-loop control ports FLAT-WIRED per ir_a_Every — `gen.γ→body`,
`body.γ→gen`, `body.ω→gen`, `gen.ω→every` — additive over literal generators; mode-2 oracle intact.
`lower_every` SM back-edge also fixed. β-synthesis in lower_icn_expr_threaded now matches Prolog
zipper rule (resumable→self, single-shot→ω_in via new icn_kind_is_resumable). FACT-RULE 0.)
✅ `grep -rnE 'seg_byte\(SEG_|SL_B\(|sl_emit_one|emit_standard_blob|bake_blob_call' src/` outside `*_templates/`+`emit_core.c` == **0**.

⛔ **SESSION 2026-05-26 (Sonnet) — J-4a LOWER + SM template + BB box reached; ONE bug remains.**

**DONE (real, verified, non-regressing — smoke_icon 5/5, rungs 198, smoke_prolog 5/5, FACT-RULE 0):**
1. **LOWER fixed (mode-2 generators now correct end-to-end).** `lower_to`/`lower_to_by` (lower.c)
   were building the BB graph then FREEING it + emitting `SM_PUSH_NULL` — the root cause of dead
   generators. Now they `SM_seq_bb_add(g_p,cfg)` to register the graph and emit `SM_BB_SWITCH`
   carrying the bb_idx, tagged `SM_BBSW_ICN_GEN` (new tag in SM.h, twin of SM_BBSW_PL_ENTRY).
   `sm_interp.c` SM_BB_SWITCH consumer got the Icon-gen arm: `bb_exec_once` first / `bb_exec_resume`
   after, γ pushes value + last_ok=1, ω resets a[0].i + last_ok=0. SM dump now shows `SM_BB_SWITCH`
   at the generator slot (was `SM_PUSH_NULL`); `every write(1 to 3)` prints `1 2 3` in --interp.
2. **SM template created** `src/emitter/SM_templates/sm_bb_switch.cpp` (wired: sm_templates.h,
   emit_core.c dispatch de-stubbed, both Makefile lists + per-file compile rule). MACRO_DEF/BINARY/
   TEXT arms. ICN_GEN TEXT arm fetches `g_stage2.sm.bb_table[idx]->entry`, sets α/β/γ/ω labels, and
   calls `walk_bb_node(gen)` — emitting the generator box's four-port x86 INLINE at emit time
   (no runtime BB walk, no C Byrd box — RULES-clean).
3. **BB box now reached + emits valid x86.** Fixed `bb_icn_to.cpp` TEXT yield: was raw-r12 push
   (brokered convention) → segfault in SM mode-4 ABI; now `mov rdi,rcx; call rt_push_int@PLT`
   matching bb_upto's TEXT convention. mode-4 emit of `every write(1 to 3)` now contains the real
   `# BOX TO(lo=1 hi=3)` inline four-port body (α sets cur, β increments, chk `jg ω`, yields via
   rt_push_int); assembles + links clean.

✅ **`lower_every` back-edge target — FIXED (2026-05-26, Opus 4.7).** The diagnosed bug
(`switch_pc = SM_label(g_p)-1` captured the CALL PC, not the SWITCH PC) is now fixed in
`lower.c` `lower_every`: capture `gen_start = g_p->count` BEFORE `lower_expr(gen_expr)`, then
scan forward `[gen_start, g_p->count)` for the first `SM_BB_SWITCH` and use that PC as the
back-edge target. SM dump now shows `SM_JUMP -> 2` (the SWITCH), not `-> 3` (the CALL). The
stray `SM_LABEL` the old `SM_label()` side-effect emitted is gone (count 15→14). **mode-2
`every write(1 to 3)` → `1 2 3` ✅; gates non-regressing (smoke_icon 5/5, broker 23, rungs 198,
smoke_prolog 5/5, FACT-RULE 0).**

⛔ **MODE 3 (`--run`) IS A GLOBAL STUB.** `--run` currently prints
`[NO-SM-BB] --run: linear emitter deleted (FACT RULE); use --interp until templates land` — the
SB-LINEAR emitter was deleted under the FACT RULE and the `bb_*`/`sm_*` mode-3 templates have not
landed. This is NOT Icon-specific; it is the Phase J work. **NEXT for this goal (per Lon's
MODE-PRIORITY directive): bring `--run` (mode 3) up via the shared template producer** — route
`--run` through `sm_emit_linear`→`sm_run_linear` (PROT_EXEC slab), reusing the SAME template
functions mode 4 uses, so mode 3 and mode 4 stay byte-identical. Until `--run` exists, generator
correctness can only be validated in mode 2.

🟡 **MODE 4 (`--compile`) — ω-exhaustion fall-through FIXED (2026-05-27, Opus 4.7).** The
generator-exhaustion (ω) path no longer falls through to the consumer. Per irgen ir_a_Every
(`p.expr.failure → p.ir.failure`), `lower_every` now stamps the loop-exit PC on the SWITCH's free
`a[0].i`, and `sm_bb_switch.cpp`'s ω arm emits `jmp .L<exit_pc>` (after `last_ok=0`), skipping the
welded consumer entirely. `every write(1 to 5)` → `1 2 3 4 5` in mode-4, byte-matching `--interp`.
**ICN-G-1 gate PASS=1** (was 0). Emitted inside the template — no second producer (FACT RULE 0).
REMAINING mode-4 generator gaps are NOT this bug: filter/cross-product cases (`every write(2<(1 to
4))`, `(1 to 3)*(1 to 2)`) run clean (no underflow) but emit no output because `SM_ACOMP` and the
binop-generator opcodes lack honest mode-4 templates — a separate rung (ICN-M4-* / per-opcode), not
every-loop wiring. `to_by` filter likewise.

**Files touched this session (Opus 4.7, mode 2/3 focus):** src/lower/lower.c (lower_every scan fix),
src/emitter/SM_templates/sm_bb_switch.cpp (α/β dispatch — mode-4, deferred). NOT yet committed.

**GATE-PK still RED/stale (455/62/592) since `a5775d1a` — owner decision on re-freeze pending. With
mode 4 deferred, GATE-PK is not a blocking gate; revisit when mode 4 resumes.**

⛔ **SESSION 2026-05-27 (Opus 4.7) — ICN-G-1 gate + mode-4 generator fixes; gate PASS=0→2.**
(1) Added `scripts/test_icon_mode4_rung.sh` (full native pipeline vs `--interp`). (2) Fixed every-loop
ω-exhaustion: `lower_every` stamps loop-exit PC on SWITCH `a[0].i`; `sm_bb_switch.cpp` ω arm emits
`jmp .L<exit>`, skipping the consumer (`every write(1 to N)` → correct). (3) `emit_sm.c` now registers
the SWITCH's ICN_GEN `a[0].i` exit PC as a jump target so `.L<exit>:` is emitted (label-analysis only,
not codegen — FACT RULE intact). (4) Fixed `sm_compare.cpp` ACOMP/LCOMP GAS macro: was `mov edi, 0`
discarding its kind arg → every comparison ran as op 0; now `mov edi, \n` (+ BINARY arm passes the
real kind). (5) Fixed `bb_to_by.cpp` TEXT yield: was raw-r12 (BINARY/brokered convention) →
SEGFAULT in mode-4; now `mov rdi,rcx; call rt_push_int@PLT` (Goal trap #2; mirrors bb_icn_to).
**ICN-G-1 PASS=2** (`to5`, `to_by`). ALL regression gates non-regressing (smoke_icon 5/5, broker 23,
rungs 198, smoke_prolog 5/5); FACT RULE 0. Remaining 3 FAILs (`lt`/`mult`/`compound`) are
filter/cross-product cases needing the BB-port-graph zipper (operand re-eval across the back-edge —
the flat SM scaffold cannot express it; documented in lower_every). Files: scripts/test_icon_mode4_rung.sh
(NEW), src/lower/lower.c, src/emitter/SM_templates/sm_bb_switch.cpp, src/emitter/emit_sm.c,

Each gets TEXT + BINARY x86 four-port body (α fresh-entry, β retry, γ success, ω fail).
Anchor gate per template: broker pattern rungs climb from RED.
`rt_cs_new` (allocates `rt_cs_t {chars,delta}`) is still live — use it for the charset state pointer.
ARBNO needs a growable frame stack; stash ptr in `pBB->counter` (intptr cast), or GC aux struct.

## ⚡ CORRECTIVE RUNGS — ZIPPER + GATE (added 2026-05-27, revised vs irgen 2026-05-27, Sonnet 4.6)

**Root diagnosis — read irgen.icn before any session touching lower_icn.c:**

The irgen.icn in `/home/claude/corpus/programs/icon/jcon-ref/irgen.icn` is the canonical source of truth for every construct's port wiring. Read the actual procedure before implementing any construct — do not rely on summaries. The following defects are confirmed against irgen:

1. **ICN-1/ICN-2 — α/β USED AS OPERAND-CHILD POINTERS.** In lower_icn.c, BB_IF stores else in `nd->ω`, BB_CALL stores args via `nd->α` γ-chain, BB_ASSIGN stores lhs/rhs in α/β. bb_exec.c walks these as child trees — AST-walking-in-disguise. Fix: one-pass signature change to carry `γ_in/ω_in/&α_out/&β_out`. See ICN-Z below.
2. **ICN-3 — NO MODE-3/4 RUNG GATE.** `test_icon_all_rungs.sh` is `--interp` only. Fix: ICN-G-1.
3. **ICN-4 — sm_bb_switch TEXT ARM VIOLATES TEMPLATE PURITY.** Calls `emit_text_n` mid-body, then returns a string. Fix: ICN-XA-1.
4. **ICN-5 — every-loop SM SCAFFOLD REDUNDANT POST-ZIPPER.** After lower_icn is fully zipper-wired, every's back-edge is a BB port wire, not SM_JUMP. Fix: ICN-Z-5.

**CRITICAL irgen-verified corrections to the prior HOW AG-LOWERING section in this file:**

- **`bounded` is NOT optional.** irgen's signature carries `bounded`: `/bounded &` guards mean the resume chunk is omitted when the context is always-bounded. In always-bounded context, β=ω_in (no retry exists), even for generator kinds. The zipper must carry a bounded flag; `icn_leaf` must respect it.
- **BB_EVERY: body.ω→expr.β, NOT body.γ→expr.β.** irgen `ir_a_Every`: BOTH `body.ir.success` AND `body.ir.failure` go to `expr.ir.resume` (≡ our expr.β). Body success and body failure both re-drive the generator. Body never fails the every-loop — only expr.failure exits to p.ir.failure. The prior HOW section said only "body.γ→expr.β"; it omitted body.ω→expr.β, which is equally essential.
- **BB_COMPOUND: intermediate statement failure ADVANCES, not retries.** irgen `ir_a_Compound`: `L[i].ir.failure → ir_Goto(L[i+1].ir.start)`. Intermediate statement failure is non-fatal and advances to the next statement. **Do NOT apply the Prolog back-to-front zipper to BB_COMPOUND/BB_SEQ.** That zipper is for `ir_Mutual` / Icon `(e1;e2;e3)` mutual evaluation (which does backtrack). Compound statements do not.
- **BB_IF: unbounded context needs an `ir_TmpLabel` resume-pointer slot.** irgen `ir_a_If` in `/bounded` context stores the active branch's resume label in a temp slot `t` (indirect goto register) so the if-node's own β can re-enter the correct branch. Simple `cond.γ→then.α, cond.ω→else.α` is only correct for always-bounded (no-retry) context. In unbounded context, implement the label-register pattern.
- **BB_TOBE / ToBy: operand evaluation is one-time (α only); β is internal.** irgen `ir_a_ToBy` uses `ir_ResumeValue` (resuming a closure) for its own resume chunk — this maps to our BB_TO_BY node's β being **self** (the node increments counter and re-checks bounds internally). The operand sub-expressions (from/to/by) are evaluated once via their own sub-graphs wired `from.success→to.start→by.start`. After by.success the closure/counter is set and the node yields. **β does not re-enter the operand sub-graphs.** The current code's α=lo_box, β=hi_box is wrong because it re-evaluates bounds on every resume.
- **BB_ALT: resume is via `ir_IndirectGoto`, not a simple port chain.** irgen `ir_a_Alt` stores the currently-active arm's resume label in a temp slot `t` (`ir_MoveLabel`) and resumes via `ir_IndirectGoto(t)`. This is NOT equivalent to a simple arm[0].ω→arm[1].α ω-chain for β. The ω-chain is for α (trying arms left-to-right on fresh entry); β re-enters only the currently-active arm via the stored label.

### Phase ICN-G — Gate infrastructure (PREREQUISITE for all emitter rungs)

#### ICN-G-1 — Build `test_icon_mode4_rung.sh` ✅ (2026-05-27, Opus 4.7)
- [x] Create `scripts/test_icon_mode4_rung.sh`: for a seed set of rung01 generator programs, runs `scrip --compile --target=x86 file.icn` → `as` (GAS, Intel syntax) → `gcc -no-pie file.o -L out -lscrip_rt -Wl,-rpath,out -lm` → execute, diff stdout against `scrip --interp file.icn` (mode-2 oracle). PASS=N FAIL=M format. emit/assemble/link/run failures are caught and counted FAIL, never fatal — harness always exits 0. **Verified: gate runs clean, reports `PASS=0 FAIL=5`** (mode-4 generators currently emit no output — the documented ω-exhaustion fall-through bug; see below).
- [x] Wire into Session Setup below alongside `test_icon_all_rungs.sh`.
- [x] **Gate threshold: mode-4 PASS ≥ 1 before any emitter rung is marked complete.** A template returning an empty string or stub jumps is NOT done (HQ Invariant 0). (Threshold is documented in the script; not yet met — that is the next emitter rung's job.)

**ICN-G-1 finding — the mode-4 every-loop underflow, now precisely located.** Emitted asm for
`every write(1 to 5)` shows BOTH the generator's `.Licngen0_γ` (success) and `.Licngen0_ω`
(exhausted, last_ok=0, NOTHING pushed) fall through into `.Licngen0_done:` → `CALL_FN write` →
`JUMP_F .L7`. On exhaustion `write` is called on an empty value-stack BEFORE the `JUMP_F` loop-exit
test runs → underflow. Root cause is structural in `lower_every` (lower.c): `lower_expr(gen_expr)`
lowers the WHOLE consuming call `write(1 to 5)`, welding `CALL_FN write` immediately after the
`SM_BB_SWITCH` inside one `lower_expr`; the `SM_JUMP_F` loop-exit is emitted AFTER and tests too
late. Correct fix belongs with ICN-Z-4/ICN-Z-9: the generator's ω port must be a control-flow edge
to loop-exit (a real port wire), not a fall-through into the consumer. Do NOT special-case a
loop-exit label into the switch template — that would seed a second control-flow scheme that drifts
from the zipper. Bring ω-as-port-wire up via the zipper, then this gate climbs from PASS=0.

#### ICN-G-2 — Re-freeze GATE-PK ⏳
- [ ] Run `bash scripts/test_per_kind_diff.sh`. For every FAIL cell: if the template body is an honest stub (returns `std::string()`), the baseline should be empty — re-freeze. If the body claims to emit real x86 but diffs fail, it is a real bug — fix first.
- [ ] Target: GATE-PK FAIL=0. NEW=0 GONE=0.
- [ ] Gate: `test_per_kind_diff.sh` PASS ≥ 504 FAIL=0 before any HQ emitter work resumes.

---

### Phase ICN-Z — Zipper rewire of lower_icn (ONE-PASS signature change)

**⚠ This is NOT additive.** All ~70 call sites in `lower_icn_expr_node` change in ONE pass. Do not attempt partial completion. Gate: `test_icon_all_rungs.sh` ≥198 after each sub-rung. `bb_exec.c` remains the mode-2 oracle.

**Before writing any code for a construct: read its `ir_a_*` procedure in irgen.icn.**
`/home/claude/corpus/programs/icon/jcon-ref/irgen.icn` — the canonical port-wiring source.

#### ICN-Z-0 — Add `icn_leaf` helper + bounded context flag ✅ (2026-05-27, Opus 4.7)
- [x] Added `icn_leaf(nd, γ_in, ω_in, &α_out, &β_out, bounded)` to `lower_icn.c` (exported in
  `lower_icn.h`). Honours bounded rule: `β=(!bounded && icn_kind_is_resumable) ? self : ω_in`.
  γ/ω stamped only when NULL and not an operand slot (mode-2 safe). Twin of `pl_leaf`.
- [x] Added `lower_icn_expr_threaded_b(..., int bounded)` bounded-aware wrapper; the legacy
  `lower_icn_expr_threaded` now delegates with `bounded=0` so the existing call site is unchanged.
- [x] **Exercised (not dead infra):** `lower_icn_proc_body` statement loop now lowers each
  statement via `lower_icn_expr_threaded_b(..., bounded=1)` — irgen `ir_a_Compound` statement
  position is always-bounded (no outer expr can resume a top-level statement). Down payment on
  ICN-Z-2.
- [x] Gate: build clean, smoke_icon 5/5, broker 23, icon_all_rungs 198, smoke_prolog 5/5,
  mode4_rung PASS=2, FACT-RULE grep 0. Non-regressing.

#### ICN-Z-1 — Rewire leaves: BB_LIT_I/F/S, BB_VAR, BB_KEYWORD, BB_FAIL, BB_BREAK, BB_NEXT ✅ (2026-05-27, Opus 4.7)
- [x] Added `icn_tree_is_leaf(e)` classifier (TT_ILIT/FLIT/QLIT/CSET/VAR/KEYWORD/LOOP_BREAK/
  LOOP_NEXT/PROC_FAIL). `lower_icn_expr_threaded_b` now seeds leaf kinds with `bounded=1` forced
  into `icn_leaf`, so a leaf's β=ω_in is guaranteed regardless of the `icn_kind_is_resumable`
  table — the leaf β-contract (irgen: a leaf's resume chunk is just Goto failure) is decoupled from
  that table. Composites keep the caller's bounded flag.
- [x] Leaves: α=self, β=ω_in (no retry). γ/ω stamped via icn_leaf when NULL + not an operand slot.
- [x] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, broker 23, icon_all_rungs 198, smoke_prolog 5/5, mode4_rung PASS=2,
  FACT-RULE grep 0. Non-regressing. `icn_tree_is_leaf` is live (defined + called).

#### ICN-Z-2 — Rewire BB_COMPOUND / BB_SEQ (Icon statement sequence) ✅ (ICN-Z-2b landed 2026-05-27d, Opus 4.7)
- [x] **Forward chain already correct.** `lower_icn_proc_body` builds the statement chain
  back-to-front with `succ` threading and lowers each statement `bounded=1` (down payment landed
  ICN-Z-0 session). `bb_exec.c` BB_SEQ walks `st = st->γ` (the γ-chain hung off α) — exactly the
  forward, non-backtracking advance irgen ir_a_Compound prescribes; intermediate failure continues
  the loop (advances), not retries.
- [x] DONE (ICN-Z-2b): explicit `stmt[i].ω → stmt[i+1].α` port wire added in `lower_icn_proc_body`
  as a post-build pass (guarded by `icn_kind_owns_omega_operand`, so BB_IF keeps ω as its else-branch
  operand). `bb_exec.c` BB_SEQ re-expressed as a PORT-FOLLOWER: advances via `st->ω` (the explicit
  edge; for ω-operand kinds advances via `st->γ`); last stmt has ω==NULL → proc terminal → FAILDESCR.
  Mirrors irgen ir_a_ProcBody (both success+failure of intermediate → next.α). Behaviour byte-identical
  to baseline (stash diff), additive, mode-2 safe. Operand composites (BINOP/CALL/IF/ALT) untouched —
  those need the full atomic ICN-Z pass.
- [x] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, smoke_prolog 5/5, rungs 198, broker 23, FACT 0 (all holding).

#### ICN-Z-3 — Rewire BB_CONJ (E1 & E2 — conjunction generator) ⛔ BLOCKED — lockstep finding (2026-05-27, Opus 4.7)
- [ ] irgen `ir_conjunction`: start→E1.start; E1.success→E2.start; E1.failure→p.failure; E2.success→p.success; E2.failure→E1.resume.
- ⛔ **CANNOT be done as an isolated rung — verified this session.** `bb_exec.c` case BB_CONJ
  (bb_exec.c:830) is the mode-2 oracle and reads `nd->α` as E1 and `nd->β` as E2 — BOTH operand
  children. The zipper needs a port for E1's RETRY entry (E2.ω→E1.β), but `BB_t` is FINAL (only
  α/β/γ/ω + payload) and both α and β are already consumed as operand-child reads. There is no free
  slot to carry the zipper wiring without ALSO rewriting `bb_exec.c` BB_CONJ to be a port-follower
  (consume γ/ω instead of recursing into α/β children). That driver rewrite cannot be partial: the
  shared `bb_exec_node` driver recurses into α/β as children for EVERY composite (BB_ASSIGN,
  BB_BINOP, BB_BINOP_GEN, …), so converting one construct to ports while the rest recurse leaves a
  hybrid the single driver cannot walk consistently. This is exactly why the goal file says ICN-Z is
  "ONE pass, ~70 sites, cannot half-zip." **BB_CONJ must be rewired in the same pass as the
  `bb_exec.c` port-follower conversion (Phase H-5 + the whole ICN-Z block), not before.**
- [ ] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, rungs ≥198 (after the full-pass rewire).

#### ICN-Z-4 — Rewire BB_EVERY ⏳ (mode-4 ω-edge landed 2026-05-27, Opus 4.7)
- [x] **Mode-4 `p.expr.failure → p.ir.failure` wired** for the direct-consumer every case: `lower_every`
  stamps loop-exit PC on SWITCH `a[0].i`; `sm_bb_switch.cpp` ω arm emits `jmp .L<exit_pc>`, skipping
  the consumer. `every write(1 to N)` correct in mode-4 (ICN-G-1 PASS=1). FACT RULE 0.
- [ ] Remaining: filter/cross-product/`to_by` every cases need honest `SM_ACOMP` + binop-generator
  mode-4 templates (separate rung — they run clean but emit no output today). The full irgen edge set
  (`body.γ→expr.β`, `body.ω→expr.β`) is mode-2-correct via BB_PUMP_PROC; mode-4 zipper still pending.
- [ ] **irgen `ir_a_Every` — read it carefully before implementing.**
  - `p.ir.start → expr.ir.start`
  - `expr.ir.success → body.ir.start`
  - `expr.ir.failure → p.ir.failure` (generator exhausted = every fails)
  - `body.ir.success → expr.ir.resume` (body done → pump generator again)
  - `body.ir.failure → expr.ir.resume` (body fail also pumps generator — both paths re-drive)
  - `p.ir.resume → ir_IndirectGoto(continue)` (only in unbounded context — for `break` etc.)
- [ ] **body.ω→expr.β is equally required as body.γ→expr.β.** Both wire to expr.resume.
- [ ] Lower expr unbounded (it is the generator). Lower body always-bounded. Wire the four edges above as BB port connections.
- [ ] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, rungs ≥198, `every write(1 to 3)` → `1 2 3`.

#### ICN-Z-5 — Rewire BB_IF ⏳
- [ ] **irgen `ir_a_If` has TWO shapes depending on `bounded`:**
  - **Always-bounded (simpler):** `expr.success→then.start; expr.failure→else.start`. then/else each wire `.success→p.success, .failure→p.failure`. No temp label needed.
  - **Unbounded:** ADDITIONALLY stores the active branch's resume in temp label `t` via `ir_MoveLabel`, so `p.ir.resume → ir_IndirectGoto(t)` can re-enter the correct branch.
- [ ] The condition expr is ALWAYS lowered always-bounded (`"always bounded"` in irgen). The then/else branches carry the caller's bounded.
- [ ] `nd->ω` in our current code stores the else-branch operand AND the failure continuation — these must be separate. The else-branch becomes its own BB subgraph; `nd->ω` becomes purely the failure continuation (as per port contract).
- [ ] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, rungs ≥198.

#### ICN-Z-6 — Rewire BB_ALT (n-ary alternation) ⏳
- [ ] **irgen `ir_a_Alt`:** α = arm[0].start. Arms chained: arm[i].failure → arm[i+1].start; last arm.failure → p.failure. Each arm.success → p.success (with MoveLabel of arm's resume into `t` in unbounded context). Resume: `ir_IndirectGoto(t)` — re-enters only the currently-active arm's resume.
- [ ] This is NOT a simple ω-chain where β tries arm[1] after arm[0] exhausts. β goes to the *same* arm that last succeeded (stored in `t`). **Do not implement as arm[0].ω→arm[1].α for β.** The ω-chain is for α-entry only.
- [ ] In always-bounded context, no `t` needed — each arm.success simply → p.success.
- [ ] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, rungs ≥198.

#### ICN-Z-7 — Rewire BB_CALL operand chain ⏳
- [ ] **irgen `ir_a_Call`:** L = [fn] ||| args. `L[i].success → L[i+1].start`; `L[i].failure → L[i-1].resume`. `L[1].failure → p.failure`. `L[-1].success → ir_Call(closure, fn, args) → ir_Move → p.success`. `p.ir.resume → ir_ResumeValue(closure, L[-1].resume) → p.success`.
- [ ] The operand chain wires sub-expressions `fn.γ→arg[0].α→arg[1].α...`; failure of any operand re-drives the previous operand. This IS a proper backtracking evaluation. Lower each sub-expression with `bounded=0` (they can be generators).
- [ ] After all operands evaluated, the call node itself: α=fn.α (chain entry). β=self (re-enters via closure resume). **`nd->α` stores the chain entry address; it is NOT the head of a γ-linked operand list as in current code.** The arg nodes are separate BB nodes wired via their own ports.
- [ ] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, rungs ≥198.

#### ICN-Z-8 — Rewire BB_TO / BB_TO_BY operand evaluation vs internal state ⏳
- [ ] **irgen `ir_a_ToBy`:** fromexpr, toexpr, byexpr are each lowered as sub-graphs. Their results are stored in temp slots `fv, tv, bv`. Chain: `from.success→to.start→by.start`. Then `by.success → ir_opfn("...", [fv,tv,bv]) → ir_Move(target, closure) → p.success`. `p.ir.resume → ir_ResumeValue(target, closure, by.resume) → p.success`.
- [ ] In our BB system: operand sub-graphs evaluated once on α-entry (wired `from.γ→to.α→by.α`); results cached in node fields. **β = self**; β-entry skips the sub-evaluation and directly increments/checks the counter. The current code's α=lo_box, β=hi_box (trying to re-read operands on every β) is wrong.
- [ ] Fix: on α, walk the operand sub-graph to get lo/hi/by values and cache them in `nd->counter` (cur) and `nd->ival` (hi/step). On β, read from those cached fields. `nd->α` in the fixed version points to the operand-chain entry (for walking on α-entry), NOT to lo_box as an always-live child pointer.
- [ ] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, rungs ≥198, `every write(1 to 3)` and `every write(1 to 9 by 3)` correct.

#### ICN-Z-9 — Delete SM back-edge from `lower_every`; verify every-loop is BB-internal ⏳
- [ ] After ICN-Z-4 lands, `lower_every` in `lower.c` no longer needs `SM_JUMP` (the back-edges are BB port wires inside the graph). Remove the `switch_pc` capture + `SM_label()` + `SM_JUMP` from `lower_every`. The SM carries only `SM_BB_SWITCH` (the generator entry).
- [ ] Verify: `--dump-sm` for `every write(1 to 3)` shows NO `SM_JUMP` targeting the switch PC.
- [ ] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, rungs ≥198.

### Phase ICN-XA — Template purity fix for sm_bb_switch ICN_GEN arm

#### ICN-XA-1 — Route ICN_GEN walk through string-returning walk_bb_node ✅ (2026-05-27c, Opus 4.7)
**⚡ This (specifically the `walk_bb_node_str` half) was the ONE prerequisite for the mode-4
`lt`/`mult`/`compound` gate movers — now landed; gate climbed PASS=2→5.**
- [x] **`walk_bb_node_str_c`** added (emit_core.c/.h): `BB_t* → char*` — `open_memstream` sink swap
  around the existing `walk_bb_node` dispatch, then restore. Caller frees. Zero `emit_text_n` inside;
  same single producer (FACT RULE grep 0).
- [x] `sm_bb_switch_str` ICN_GEN arm rewired to `pre + walk_bb_node_str_c(gen) + post` — the
  LOCAL-PURGE violation (emit_text_n + walk_bb_node mid-body) removed; arm is pure.
- [x] Gate: smoke_icon 5/5, broker 23, rungs 198, smoke_prolog 5/5, mode4_rung PASS=5, FACT RULE 0.
- [ ] (follow-on) The PL_ENTRY arm still has an `emit_text_n` + `walk_bb_flat` mid-body — Prolog scope,
  not Icon; convert when `walk_bb_flat` gets a string variant.

---

### Phase ICN-M4 — Mode-4 emitter rungs (only after ICN-G-1 exists + ICN-Z complete)

**Do NOT begin these until ICN-G-1 gate script exists AND ICN-Z-1..9 are complete.**

#### ICN-M4-1 — `bb_icn_to.cpp` literal generator: honest TEXT + BINARY x86 ⏳
- [ ] LITERAL fast-path TEXT arm exists. Verify via `test_icon_mode4_rung.sh`. If PASS ≥ 1, mark done.
- [ ] BINARY arm: raw x86 (counter in `&pBB->counter`; `cmp; jg ω; rt_push_int; jmp γ; β: add; jmp check`).
- [ ] DYNAMIC operand arm: after ICN-Z-8, α-entry walks operand sub-graph to populate counter/ival; the template reads those cached fields.

#### ICN-M4-2 — `bb_to_by.cpp` literal generator: honest BINARY + dynamic arms ⏳
- [ ] Same pattern as ICN-M4-1. Literal TEXT arm exists; verify via gate. Add BINARY and dynamic.

#### ICN-M4-3 — TEXT arms: rt_push_int@PLT, not raw r12 ⏳
- [ ] TEXT arm (mode-4) must use `mov rdi,<v>; call rt_push_int@PLT`. BINARY arm uses raw r12. Audit both templates.

## THE FOUR FACTS — READ FIRST

1. **C WALKERS: MODE 2 ONLY.** `icn_bb_dcg` / `bb_exec_once` / `bb_exec_resume` / `bb_exec.c` — permitted in `--interp` only.
2. **NO C WALKERS IN MODE 3/4.** Those symbols stay DEFINED (mode 2 needs them) but UNREACHABLE from `--run`/`--compile`.
3. **SM + BB DO NOT EXIST AT RUNTIME IN MODE 3/4.** Emitter reads them once, bakes flat-wired x86. `scrip.c` frees SM+BB before the runner executes.
4. **ONE x86 PRODUCER.** `src/emitter/ + BB_templates/*.cpp / SM_templates/ / XA_templates/` only. A second producer ALWAYS drifts.
5. **TEMPLATE-ONLY EMISSION (FACT RULE).** Every byte of emitted x86 lives in a template function keyed to a BB/SM/XA opcode, reached only via `emit_core.c` dispatch. `grep -rnE 'seg_byte\(SEG_CODE|SL_B\(|sl_emit_one|emit_standard_blob' src/` outside `*_templates/` + `emit_core.c` == 0.

**Completion test:** from any `--run`/`--compile` entry, reachability to `icn_bb_dcg`/`pl_bb_dcg`/`bb_exec_once`/`bb_exec_resume` == ZERO.

**Other rules:** NO AST WALKING modes 2/3/4. ZERO C Byrd-box functions (`DESCR_t foo(void*,int entry)`); only exempt: `icn_bb_dcg`, `icn_bb_oneshot`. NO new C functions in `icon_box_rt.c`/`rt.c` to back a template — logic lives inline in `bb_*.cpp`. CONSULT `irgen.icn` before any BB kind (`/home/claude/corpus/programs/icon/jcon-ref/irgen.icn`).

---

## Architecture

```
.icn → icon_parse() → AST_t*
  --interp   → execute_program() → interp_eval()        Mode 2 (SM+BB C walker, reference)
  --run      → lower() → sm_codegen_x64() → exec        Mode 3 (in-proc, PROT_EXEC)
  --compile  → lower() → sm_codegen_x64() → binary      Mode 4 (separate process)
```

`tree_t` → `lower()` → SM bootstrap + `BB_graph_t`. **BB_t IS the IR** (≡ JCON `ir_*`). NOT a tree.

**GOLDEN BB RULE:** BB_t has ONLY: `t` (kind), `α β γ ω` (port ptrs), `sval`/`ival`/`dval` (IR payload), `value`/`counter`/`state` (interp runtime). No `c[]`/`n`/`lhs`/`rhs`/`opaque`/`sval2`/`ival2`/`ival3`. **BB_t struct is FINAL.**

**Four ports (AG over lowering):**
| Port | Direction | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| γ | DOWN (inherited) | success continuation |
| ω | DOWN (inherited) | failure continuation |
| α | UP (synthesized) | fresh-entry address |
| β | UP (synthesized) | retry-entry address |

Signature: `lower(cfg, tree, γ_in, ω_in, &α_out, &β_out)`. JCON `{start,resume,success,failure}` → `α/β/γ/ω`.

---

## Done when
1. Every AST kind reachable from a `--interp` PASS Icon program lowers via `lower.c` to pure SM/BB.
2. Every SM opcode Icon emits has a `sm_codegen_x64` mirror.
3. `is_suspendable` / `coro_eval` not reachable from SM dispatch.
4. Mode 3 and mode 4 execute the IDENTICAL emitter-produced flat-wired x86, differing only in process boundary.

---

## Phase H — Attribute Grammar (pointers, no label IR)

#### H-1 — 4-attribute lowerer ✅ SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE
- [x] Threaded signature + back-to-front spine; leaves compose; top γ/ω seeded NULL=trampoline-halt.
- [x] BB_IF else→ω. BB_CONJ (`E1 & E2`) own opcode.
- [x] Cross-arg odometer: multi-generator CALL args cross-product (rungs 196→198). Side-effect fix: single-shot args cached, not re-evaluated.
- [ ] **REMAINING:** DOWN-threading of γ/ω into then/else/body for nested non-leaf IF. Blocked: `if` not accepted in expression position by parser (GOAL-PARSER-ICON prereq). Generator-composition corners verified clean.

#### H-2 — BB_SEQ child-array → γ-chain ⏳

## Phase J — Mode 3 executes shared emitter's flat-wired x86

**Root cause of RED:** `scrip.c` mode_run frees `bb_table` + SM before the runner executes; the old baked `rt_bb_pump_proc` read freed `bb_table[]` → NULL → crash. Fix: mode 3 EMITs via the shared template producer, not a C walker.

#### J-2 — memstream sink ✅ (`106b7c51`)
`open_memstream` FILE* sink for `codegen_sm_x86`. `--memcheck` proves memstream==file bytes 3/3.

#### J-3 — `call rel32` to proc SM entry_pc ✅ (`de0f2352`)

#### J-4 — route SM_BB_PUMP_PROC through J-2/J-3 ⏳
- [x] `hello` prints; `double(21)`=42; SM_ACOMP/LCOMP wired; SM_LOAD/STORE_FRAME via rt helpers.
- [ ] **NEXT (J-4a): GENERATORS.** `every`/`to`/`by` abort flag-on. Root cause: `bb_icn_to_by.cpp` / `bb_icn_to.cpp` PLATFORM_X86 arms now hollow (deleted with `rt_bb_*`). Fix = implement four-port literal generator x86 in those templates. Probe: `every write(1 to 3)` → `1 2 3` flag-on.

#### J-5 — migrate PUMP_SM, PUMP_CASE, BB_SWITCH, generator path ⏳
#### J-6 — flip default to flat BB; delete C bridge ⏳

**Phase J done when:** mode 3 ≡ mode 4 flat-wired x86; `icn_bb_dcg`/`bb_exec.c` unreachable from `--run`; smoke 5/5, broker ≥23, rungs ≥198, ASAN clean.

## ⚡ HOW AG-LOWERING + EMITTER TEMPLATES ACTUALLY WORK (Sonnet, 2026-05-26 — learned by reading code)

Hard-won mental model. Read this before touching generators; it cost a full session to assemble.

### The two-stage pipeline, concretely

```
Icon AST → LOWER (builds SM bootstrap + BB graph) → EMITTER walks BB at emit time → x86 via templates
```

There are TWO lowerers and they are NOT the same file:
- `lower.c` — the SM-spine lowerer. Emits the flat `SM_sequence_t` (PUSH/CALL/JUMP/BB_SWITCH...).
  This is the "bootstrap" / statement scaffold. `lower_to`, `lower_to_by`, `lower_every` live here.
- `lower_icn.c` — the BB-graph builder. `lower_icn_expr_top(tree)` returns a `BB_graph_t*` whose
  `->entry` is a four-port-wired `BB_t` tree. THIS is the IR the emitter walks. `BB_t IS the IR`.

The bridge between them: `SM_seq_bb_add(g_p, cfg)` registers a `BB_graph_t*` into
`g_stage2.sm.bb_table[]` and returns an `int bb_idx`. The SM carries that idx in an
`SM_BB_SWITCH` instruction. This is the SAME mechanism SNOBOL4 patterns use (`SM_EXEC_STMT`
carries a bb_idx) and Prolog uses (`SM_BB_SWITCH` + `SM_BBSW_PL_ENTRY`). One pattern, three langs.

### Attribute Grammar = the four ports, threaded by lower_icn.c

γ/ω are INHERITED (passed DOWN into children): success-continuation, fail-continuation.
α/β are SYNTHESIZED (returned UP from children): fresh-entry addr, retry-entry addr.
Signature shape: `lower(cfg, tree, γ_in, ω_in, &α_out, &β_out)`. Leaf: `α=β=self; γ=γ_in; ω=ω_in`.
Composition wires child.γ → next sibling, last.γ → parent.γ, etc. (see `lower_icn.c` arg-γ-chain
at the `BB_CALL` case: `args[j-1]->γ = args[j]`). The mode-2 reference walker `bb_exec.c`
(was `ir_exec.c`) executes this graph by following ports — it is the SEMANTIC SOURCE OF TRUTH for
every BB kind. To implement any construct: read its `case BB_X:` in bb_exec.c, translate to x86.

**ALL FOUR PORTS MUST BE WIRED — flat-wired, no NULL, no trampoline (corrected 2026-05-26, Opus
4.7, after Lon).** The canonical model is JCON `irgen.icn` `record ir_info(start, resume, failure,
success)` ≡ our `α/β/γ/ω`. In irgen EVERY chunk wires EVERY port to a concrete target via
`ir_Goto(coord, <other-port>)` — there is NO NULL exit and NO fall-through to any "trampoline/halt".
Even a LEAF wires all ports: `ir_a_Intlit` does `start: [IntLit; Goto(success)]` and (bounded)
`resume: [Goto(failure)]`. A generator like `ir_a_ToBy` wires eight chunks — `start→fromexpr.start`,
`resume→[ResumeValue; Goto success]`, `fromexpr.success→toexpr.start`,
`fromexpr.failure→ir.failure`, `toexpr.success→byexpr.start`, `toexpr.failure→fromexpr.resume`,
`byexpr.success→[opfn; Move; Goto success]`, `byexpr.failure→toexpr.resume`. Every port lands on a
port; the top-level seeds the terminal success/failure with real halt chunks.

⛔ **OUR CURRENT lower_icn.c DIVERGES — this is the real defect to fix.** Two problems:
(1) **Leaves leave ports NULL.** `BB_node_alloc` NULLs α/β/γ/ω and leaf cases (TT_ILIT/TT_VAR/…)
set only the payload (ival/sval), never wiring start→success / resume→failure as irgen requires.
(2) **α/β are OVERLOADED as operand-child pointers, not control-flow ports.** e.g. TT_TO_BY does
`nd->α = lo; nd->β = hi;` (the lo/hi OPERAND boxes), and the BB_CALL case chains args as
`e->α … a = a->γ` (γ = "next operand sibling"). So `bb_exec.c` walks α/β/γ as an OPERAND TREE in C —
that is AST-walking-in-disguise and is exactly what flat-wiring must eliminate. It "works" in mode 2
ONLY because the C executor patches the holes at runtime (the `? : NULL` guards I earlier mis-read
as "design"). Flat-wired x86 (mode 3/4) has nowhere to fall back to: an unwired port = jump-to-
garbage; an operand-in-port = no control-flow successor at all. **NEXT (mode 2→3): rewire lower_icn.c
so α/β/γ/ω are PURE control-flow links per irgen — operands become separate boxes whose `success`
(γ) flows into the next box's `start` (α) — and verify against `bb_exec.c` re-expressed as a flat
port-follower (no tree recursion). Read each `ir_a_*` in irgen.icn for the exact per-port wiring.**

#### Canonical per-port wiring (extracted from irgen.icn — α=start β=resume γ=success ω=failure)

Terminal seeding (`ir_a_ProcBody`/`ir_a_ProcCode`): the proc's last stmt `γ → proc.γ` and
`ω → proc.ω`; proc.γ/proc.ω are real terminal chunks (`ir_Fail`/halt). The buck stops at concrete
top-level chunks — NEVER a NULL or an implicit trampoline.

- **Intlit/Reallit/Stringlit/Csetlit (leaf):** `α: [emit lit; Goto γ]`; (bounded) `β: [Goto ω]`.
- **Ident/Var (leaf):** same shape — `α` does the load then `Goto γ`; `β → ω`.
- **ToBy:** `α→from.α`; `β: [ResumeValue; Goto γ]`; `from.γ→to.α`; `from.ω→ω`; `to.γ→by.α`;
  `to.ω→from.β`; `by.γ: [opfn "..."; Move target; Goto γ]`; `by.ω→to.β`.
- **Every:** `α→expr.α`; `expr.γ→body.α`; `expr.ω→ω`; `body.γ→expr.β`; `body.ω→expr.β`.
  (`body.γ→expr.β` IS the loop back-edge — a PORT WIRE, not an SM_JUMP. The whole loop is BB-graph
  internal; no SM scaffold needed once lower_icn wires it.)
- **If:** `α→cond.α`; `cond.γ→then.α`; `cond.ω→else.α` (or `→ω` if no else); `then.γ→γ`;
  `then.ω→ω`; `else.γ→γ`; `else.ω→ω`. (Read ir_a_If:577 for the exact bounded/rval variant.)
- **Compound (seq):** chain `stmt[i].γ→stmt[i+1].α`; last `.γ→γ`; failures per ir_a_Compound:1231.
- **Alt (`E1|E2`):** `α→e1.α`; `e1.γ→γ`; `e1.ω→e2.α`; `e2.γ→γ`; `e2.ω→ω`; resume re-enters the
  currently-active arm (ir_a_Alt:167).
- **Field/Binop/Unop/Call:** operand boxes are SEPARATE nodes wired `operand.γ→next.α`; the op's own
  `α` is the first operand's `α`, the result is produced in the last operand's `γ` chunk which then
  `Goto γ`. Operands are NOT stored in α/β as child pointers (our current bug).

REWIRE ORDER (mode 2 must stay green each step — bb_exec.c is the oracle): (1) leaves
(Intlit/Var/Stringlit/Cset) wire α→γ, β→ω; (2) ProcBody/ProcCode terminal seeding; (3) Compound
seq γ-chain; (4) If/Alt; (5) ToBy/Every/Upto generators (back-edge = body.γ→expr.β port wire);
(6) Call/Binop operand-box chains (retire α/β-as-operand-child). After each: smoke_icon 5/5,
rungs ≥198. bb_exec.c must be re-expressed as a pure port-follower (no `a = a->γ` operand-tree
recursion) once ports are control-flow only.

#### THE ZIPPER — copy Prolog's lower_pl.c exactly (Lon, 2026-05-26). lower_pl ALREADY does this.

Two inherited attrs go DOWN (γ_in, ω_in = where to go on success/fail); two synthesized attrs come
UP (α_out, β_out = my fresh-entry, my retry-entry). Signature (mirror EXACTLY):
`lower_icn_expr_node(cfg, e, BB_t *γ_in, BB_t *ω_in, BB_t **α_out, BB_t **β_out)`.

LEAF SEEDER (twin of `pl_leaf`, lower_pl.c:21 — add `icn_leaf`):
```c
static BB_t *icn_leaf(BB_t *nd, BB_t *γ_in, BB_t *ω_in, BB_t **α_out, BB_t **β_out){
    if(!nd) return NULL;
    nd->γ=γ_in; nd->ω=ω_in;            /* inherited DOWN */
    if(α_out)*α_out=nd;                /* leaf is its own fresh-entry, synth UP */
    if(β_out)*β_out=ω_in;              /* leaf has no retry: β=ω → ω-chain skips through it */
    return nd; }
```
Every leaf case becomes: `return icn_leaf(nd, γ_in, ω_in, α_out, β_out);` (see lower_pl.c:62-63).

CONJUNCTION/SEQ = back-to-front zipper (lower_pl_goal conjunction, lower_pl.c:160-203):
build goal[n-1] first with γ=γ_in; then i=n-2..0 with `my_γ = gα[i+1]` (success→next entry);
wire `goal[i].ω = gβ[i-1]` (fail→redo nearest LEFT generator). β-by-kind:
resumable (generators: TO/TO_BY/UPTO/ALT/EVERY/PROC_GEN…) → β=self; non-resumable → β=left neighbor's β.

DISJUNCTION/ALT (lower_pl.c:206-217): lower 2nd branch first (γ_in,ω_in)→bα; lower 1st with
`ω=bα` (1st fails→try 2nd)→aα; node α=aα β=bα γ=γ_in ω=ω_in.

This is NOT additive — it is a signature change touching ~70 call sites in lower_icn_expr_node, done
in ONE pass top-to-bottom (you cannot half-zip). After: α/β/γ/ω are PURE control flow; retire the
α/β-as-operand reads in bb_exec.c (operands become boxes wired operand.γ→next.α). Gate each language
construct group: smoke_icon 5/5, rungs ≥198. EVERY already pre-wired (gen.γ→body, body.γ→gen,
gen.ω→every) for literal generators — fold into the zipper when EVERY's turn comes.

### EMITTER templates — the THREE things that are easy to get wrong

1. **emit_core.c is DISPATCH-ONLY.** Template bodies live in `BB_templates/bb_*.cpp`,
   `SM_templates/sm_*.cpp`, `XA_templates/xa_*.cpp`. emit_core just does `case BB_X: bb_x(nd);`.
   A template emitting empty string / stub jumps is NOTHING (Invariant 0). Real GAS in MEDIUM_TEXT
   AND real bytes in MEDIUM_BINARY, or it is not done.

2. **There are TWO value-stack conventions and they DIFFER BY MEDIUM. This is the #1 trap.**
   - MEDIUM_TEXT (mode-4 `--compile`): values go through the rt ABI — `mov rdi,<v>; call rt_push_int@PLT`.
     This is what `bb_upto.cpp` TEXT does and what WORKS in the SM mode-4 ABI.
   - MEDIUM_BINARY (mode-3 flat/brokered): raw `r12` value-stack — `mov [r12+8],rax; add r12,16`.
   `bb_icn_to.cpp` originally used raw-r12 in its TEXT arm (brokered convention) → SEGFAULT in
   mode-4 because r12 is not set up as a vstack there. FIX was `rt_push_int@PLT`. When you write a
   TEXT arm, push via rt helpers; r12 is for BINARY only. (Invariants 8/9: BINARY must embed no
   emitter-process pointers and no four-port rt_* helper; TEXT may `call util@PLT` for non-port utils.)

3. **last_ok is a FUNCTION, not a data symbol.** `nm` shows `T rt_last_ok` (getter) and
   `T rt_set_last_ok` (setter). Writing `mov [rip+rt_last_ok],1` corrupts code. Use
   `mov rdi,<0|1>; call rt_set_last_ok@PLT`.

### How to make a registered generator graph emit inline (the SM_BB_SWITCH ICN_GEN pattern)

The SM_BB_SWITCH template, for an Icon generator, fetches `g_stage2.sm.bb_table[idx]->entry`,
sets `g_emit.lbl_α/β/γ/ω` (+ `_p` pointers) to fresh labels, then calls `walk_bb_node(gen, out)`.
walk_bb_node dispatches to the box's `bb_*` template, which emits its α-body at lbl_α and jumps to
lbl_γ/ω/β. The SM template then defines those labels: γ → set last_ok=1 + continue; ω → set
last_ok=0 + continue. This emits the box's four-port x86 INLINE at emit time — NO runtime BB walk,
NO C Byrd box (the PD-8 trap). MUST set lbl_α too or the box emits `(null):` → assembler error.

### The every-loop back-edge gotcha (the open J-4a bug)

`lower_every` (lower.c) captures `switch_pc = SM_label-1` AFTER `lower_expr(gen_expr)`. For
`every write(1 to 3)`, gen_expr is the WHOLE call, so lower_expr emits SM_BB_SWITCH (inner `to`)
THEN SM_CALL_FN write — `switch_pc` wrongly points at the CALL. The loop back-edge must re-enter
the GENERATOR's switch PC, not the consuming CALL. Fix: locate the SM_BB_SWITCH PC emitted within
gen_expr (or lower the bare generator separately from its consumer body). mode-2 is immune because
SM_BB_PUMP_PROC drives the whole proc via the C graph walk, ignoring the SM loop scaffold.

### Gate reality

- `test_icon_all_rungs.sh` is `--interp` (mode-2) ONLY — pinned ~198 regardless of emitter work.
  It CANNOT measure mode-4 generator progress. Build a mode-4 Icon rung gate (mirror Prolog GATE-3:
  per-rung emit→assemble→link→run, assert == mode-2 output) to make EMITTER rungs honestly count.
- GATE-PK (per-kind) is the emitter-output gate but has been stale-RED since `a5775d1a` (baseline
  not re-frozen across ~9 emitter commits). Owner decision needed: verify cells then re-freeze.
