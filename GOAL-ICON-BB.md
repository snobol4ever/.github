# GOAL-ICON-BB.md — Icon, 100% Byrd Boxes, from zero

## ⛔ NO C BYRD-BOX FUNCTIONS — A BOX IS ENTERED BY JUMPING TO ITS α/β LABELS, NEVER A `(ζ, int entry)` C CALL (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md, GOAL-SNOCONE-IR-BB.md)

**There is NO such thing as a C byrd-box function. The "brokered BB" concept is ABOLISHED.** A byrd box is
EMITTED machine code. It has exactly TWO entry points, and they are **LABELS** — α (fresh entry) and β
(resume). Control reaches a box by **JUMPING to one of those labels**. A box is NEVER a C function, is NEVER
reached by a C call, and NEVER takes an integer `entry` argument to select α vs β. The C signature
`DESCR_t NAME(void *ζ, int entry)` — a ζ-state pointer plus an `int entry` α/β selector — is **FORBIDDEN**.
It was the discredited brokered-BB calling convention (an "entry kludge"); it is gone. The ONLY driver is the
**mode-2 BB-graph interpreter** (`bb_exec.c`), which walks the IR graph directly and IS the broker/driver;
**modes 3 and 4 are native code in which boxes thread control by jumping between α/β labels** (RULES X86-64
register / subject-model convention) — never through a function pointer plus an `entry` integer. There is no
`bb_broker` driver and no `(ζ, int entry)` box anywhere.

**HISTORY — READ THIS, because it is why the rule now exists in this strongest form.** This prohibition has
stood for **AT LEAST TWO MONTHS**. Lon ordered these C `(ζ, int entry)` byrd boxes DELETED at least **THREE
separate times**, and each time a session either declined, re-introduced them, or held/reverted the deletion
"to keep the build green." A prior plain rule (RULES.md "NO C BYRD-BOX FUNCTIONS") did **not** hold. They
were finally deleted **2026-06-01** — the `pl_*_fn` family (all of `pl_broker.c`), `gen_bb_dcg`,
`gen_bb_oneshot`, `resolve_bb_dcg`, `bb_deferred_var`/`_exported`, `fail_box`, the dead `bb_cap`/`bb_atp`
declarations, **and the `bb_broker` driver itself** (`bb_broker.c`). **KEEPING THE BUILD GREEN IS NOT A
LICENSE TO PRESERVE A FORBIDDEN BOX.** When this signature and a green build conflict, the **signature
loses**: delete the box and tear out its callers (the brokered execution path — Prolog `--run`, brokered
pattern scan, brokered generators — is removed, not preserved). A broken build pending the caller teardown is
acceptable; a surviving `(ζ, int entry)` box is not.

**COMPLETION TEST:** (a) `grep -rnE 'DESCR_t[[:space:]]+[A-Za-z_]+[[:space:]]*\([[:space:]]*void[[:space:]]*\*[[:space:]]*[a-z]*[[:space:]]*,[[:space:]]*int[[:space:]]+entry' src/ --include=*.c --include=*.cpp --include=*.h | grep -v typedef` == 0 (no C byrd-box definition or declaration with the `(ζ, int entry)` signature); (b) no `bb_broker` driver function exists; (c) every emitted box is entered by a jump to an α or β label, never a C call with an `entry` int; (d) this FACT RULE body is byte-identical across the five GOAL-*-BB files.

## ⛔ NO VALUE STACK — EVER (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md, GOAL-SNOCONE-IR-BB.md)

**SCRIP HAS NO VALUE STACK. NO SESSION, IN ANY LANGUAGE, MAY CREATE ONE.** (Lon directive, 2026-05-31.)
There is nothing like a value stack in SCRIP — every value a BB graph computes or holds at run time lives
INSIDE a box: a READ-ONLY operand constant reached `[rip+disp]` into sealed data, or a READ-WRITE slot
reached `[ζ=r12+off]` in the per-sequence one-register frame (the `test_sno_1.c`/`test_icon.c` named-slot
model). A consumer reads a producer's result directly from that producer's slot. A value is NEVER pushed
to or popped from a global stack, and intermediate producer→consumer values are NEVER threaded through a
name-table round-trip. This is the same law as the PER-BOX LOCAL STORAGE FACT RULE; this rule states the
prohibition in the strongest, language-independent form so it cannot be re-introduced from any session.

**The `g_vstack` global array is DELETED (2026-05-31) and must NEVER be resurrected** — nor any equivalent
under a different name (`*_vstack[]`, `value_stack`, `g_estack`, a hand-rolled `WamWord[]`/`DESCR_t[]`
push/pop arena used to pass values between boxes, etc.). FORBIDDEN to (re)introduce: a global/static array
whose purpose is to push a box's value and pop it in a consumer; `rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*`/`vstack_*` value
traffic; any `*_push`/`*_pop` helper that moves an *intermediate* value between boxes. (KEEP, NOT a value
stack: the Prolog trail `g_resolve_trail`/`rt_pl_trail_*` — a binding-undo ledger; the choice-point ledger
`g_resolve_bfr`/`resolve_choice` — the irreducible cross-node resume spine; the C call stack used for
genuine recursion; an ARBNO-style explicit indexed per-activation frame array. None of these is a value
stack.) The residual `vstack_*`/`rt_vstack_ops_t` SCAFFOLDING left in `src/runtime/rt/rt.c` is dead/aborting
(`g_ops` only ever points at `g_default_ops`, whose push/pop/peek `abort()`); it is being removed rung by
rung (the VSX ladder) and must NOT be wired up to anything — adding a real backing store to it = creating a
value stack = a violation.

**GUARD:** `scripts/test_gate_no_vstack.sh` (informational baseline now; flips to a HARD `--strict`
zero-check at VSX-8). It greps (comments stripped) ACROSS ALL `src/` for `g_vstack`/`vstack_push`/
`vstack_pop`/`vstack_peek`/`rt_vstack_*`. The `g_vstack` token is already at ZERO and must STAY at zero;
the rest trend to zero as the scaffolding is deleted. Any session that makes the `g_vstack` count non-zero,
or that adds a new value-stack array under any name, has violated this rule. **COMPLETION TEST:** (a)
`grep -rn 'g_vstack' src/` == 0 (code AND comments); (b) no new global/static push/pop value arena exists;
(c) `scripts/test_gate_no_vstack.sh` `g_vstack` line reads 0; (d) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical
across all five GOAL-*-BB files.

## ⛔ TWO LITERAL FORMS ONLY — MEDIUM_BINARY IS A HAND-CODED LITERAL BYTE MAP; NO FUNCTION MAY COUNT BYTES (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md, GOAL-RAKU-BB.md, GOAL-SNOCONE-IR-BB.md)

**Every BB template emits its x86 in exactly TWO LITERAL forms, both counted BY HAND.** (1) `MEDIUM_BINARY`
is a hand-coded LITERAL byte map — `bytes("\x..")` opcode literals plus a LITERAL patch-offset map
(`bin = {{13,65,80,84,95}, {…}, {…}}` with HARDCODED constant offsets). (2) `MEDIUM_TEXT` is literal GAS asm.
Both forms are LITERALS. This is DELIBERATE, not a stopgap: a single shared/computed template proved
unmaintainable — it kept getting split apart — so each box is its own small template carrying its own
hand-coded byte map, and that literal form is the one that stays correct. (Lon directive, 2026-06-01 —
re-issued after a session INVERTED it: literal bytes + literal asm are RIGHT; the function-counter is WRONG.)

**FORBIDDEN — the ONLY thing that makes a site BAD: using a FUNCTION to count or compute the bytes.**
Specifically `b.size()` in any form (`bin.sites.push_back((int)b.size())`, `int off = (int)b.size()`,
`int mr_off = (int)b.size()`), or any helper that DERIVES a patch offset from the running buffer length
instead of a hardcoded literal constant. Every offset in `bin` must be a LITERAL integer, never a function
of the buffer. (CARVE-OUT: `bb_emit_asm_result` in `emit_str.cpp` may walk the FINISHED byte string with
`.size()` when it emits/patches — that is the consumer reading a complete literal, NOT a template counting
its own bytes; the prohibition is on a TEMPLATE deriving its patch offsets from a function.)

**NOT bad — explicitly allowed, do NOT flag or "fix" these:** hand-written `bytes("\x..")` opcode literals;
hardcoded `bin = {{…},{…},{…}}` literal offset tuples; literal internal rel32 deltas (`+65`, `-98`) written
as constants; `u8()/u32le()/u64le()` building literal immediates; `TEMPLATE_ADDR_*` address bakes. These ARE
the hand-coded byte map — the CORRECT, supported form. A box that hand-encodes bytes with literal offsets is GREEN.

**GUARD:** `scripts/test_gate_no_handencoded_bytes.sh` (informational baseline now; flips to a HARD `--strict`
zero-check). It counts, per `BB_templates/*.cpp` (comments stripped), every `b.size()` — the function
byte-counter — which is the ONLY bad pattern. The count only ever decreases as `b.size()` sites are rewritten
to literal offset maps; any session that raises it has violated this rule. **COMPLETION TEST:** (a)
`scripts/test_gate_no_handencoded_bytes.sh --strict` green — zero `b.size()` in any `BB_templates/*.cpp`;
(b) every `MEDIUM_BINARY` arm uses a hand-coded LITERAL byte map with hardcoded offsets, never a function to
count bytes; (c) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical across all five GOAL-*-BB files.

## ⛔ SHARED-LOWERER ONE-FILE CONCURRENCY (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md)

The unified AST→IR lowerer is **ONE file** — `src/lower/lower.c` (formerly `lower2.c`, the new tree root after old `lower.c` was deleted 2026-05-31) — with **ONE entry** (`lower2`, role-seeded via `lower2_{value,pattern,goal}_entry`) and **ONE big switch over the shared `tree_e`** (every `TT_*`). SNOBOL4, Icon, and Prolog are developed CONCURRENTLY in SEPARATE sessions, all writing into this one file. Each language adds ARMS the others don't; the discipline below makes three concurrent sessions **conflict-free and mutually beneficial** (one session's added case label / shared helper is the next session's ready slot):

1. **ONE CASE PER KIND.** Each `TT_*` is at most ONE `case` label per role switch. If your language needs a kind with no case yet → ADD the case. If the case exists → ADD YOUR ARM to it. **NEVER duplicate the label.** (Win-win: SNOBOL4 adding `case TT_ASSIGN` hands Icon/Prolog a ready slot.)

2. **LANGUAGE VARIATION LIVES INSIDE THE CASE — NEVER A PER-LANGUAGE FORK.** When a kind behaves differently per language, branch on `cx.lang` (or role) WITHIN the one case (`switch (cx.lang) { case IR_LANG_SNO: …; case IR_LANG_PL: …; }`, or if/else). No per-language lowering functions, no per-language files. One kind → one case → language arms inside.

3. **EDIT ONLY YOUR OWN LANGUAGE'S ARM.** A session may ADD or MODIFY the `cx.lang` arm for its OWN language inside any case. It must **NEVER modify, reorder, or delete another language's arm.** This is what makes the three sessions' diffs non-overlapping → git auto-merges with **zero conflicts**.

4. **A MISSING LANGUAGE ARM FALLS LOUD, NEVER SILENT.** Inside a case, a language with no arm yet routes to `lower_unhandled` (loud stderr + NULL) — never a silent or wrong default. A half-built arm fails LOUDLY so it can never corrupt a peer's proven path.

5. **SHARED SCAFFOLDING IS ADDITIVE; SIGNATURE/SEMANTIC CHANGES ARE LOCKSTEP.** The cursor (`lcx_t`), the port primitives (`nalloc`/`set_succ_fail`/`ret`/`emit_leaf`), and the match-collect library (`tm`/`tm_g`) are SHARED. ADDING a helper or a case label is free (no conflict). CHANGING the signature/semantics of an existing shared helper or of `lcx_t` affects all three cats → it MUST update all three GOAL files' FACT RULE in the SAME commit and re-prove all three.

6. **THE TOPOLOGY PROOF GATE IS THE SHARED GREEN SIGNAL.** `scripts/prove_lower2.sh` must stay green before every commit. Each cat's proof cases are ADDITIVE (append your own; never delete a peer's). Green = your arm wired right AND you didn't disturb a peer.

**COMPLETION TEST:** (a) no duplicated `case TT_` label within any one switch in `lower.c`; (b) every case's language branches end in a real arm or `lower_unhandled` (no silent default); (c) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical across the three GOAL files (`awk '/SHARED-LOWERER ONE-FILE/{p=1} p{print} /prove_lower2.sh green/{if(p)exit}'` md5 matches — first-match, not greedy `sed`); (d) `scripts/prove_lower2.sh` green.

## ⛔ TEMPLATE-ONLY EMISSION — ONE-DISPATCH CONCURRENCY (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md)

The unified IR→x86 emitter is **ONE dispatch** — `src/emitter/emit_core.c`'s `switch (nd->t)` over the shared `IR_e` — fanning out to **per-box template functions** under `src/emitter/{BB,SM,XA}_templates/`. Every byte of emitted machine code lives INSIDE a template fn reached ONLY via this dispatch (RULES.md TEMPLATE-ONLY). SNOBOL4, Icon, and Prolog fill emitter boxes CONCURRENTLY in SEPARATE sessions, all writing into this one dispatch + this one template tree. The discipline below makes the three sessions **conflict-free and mutually beneficial** (one session's dispatch case + template file is the next session's ready slot), exactly mirroring the SHARED-LOWERER rule:

1. **ONE DISPATCH CASE PER IR KIND.** Each `IR_*` is at most ONE `case` label in `emit_core.c`. If your language's kind has no case → ADD it (one line: `case IR_FOO: bb_foo(nd); return 0;`). If it exists → it already calls the right template; do not duplicate. **NEVER duplicate the label.** Append new cases at the END of the language's contiguous block (SNOBOL `IR_PAT_*` block, Prolog `IR_GOAL/ARITH/BUILTIN/LOGICVAR/ATOM/STRUCT/UNIFY/CUT/DISJ/GCONJ` block, Icon `IR_EVERY/ALT/LIMIT/SCAN/TO/…` block) so the three sessions' inserts land in different hunks → git auto-merges.

2. **ONE TEMPLATE FILE PER BOX — NEVER A SHARED MEGA-FILE.** Each box's bytes live in its OWN `.cpp` (e.g. `bb_pat_len.cpp`, `bb_unify.cpp`, `bb_every.cpp`). A session creating a new box CREATES a new file; it never appends a second box's body into a peer's file. Per-box files = per-session non-overlapping edits. Duplicating a byte pattern INTO each template is REQUIRED (duplication is the point — RULES.md); never factor shared bytes into a common emitter helper that two languages edit.

3. **EDIT ONLY YOUR OWN LANGUAGE'S BOXES.** A session may ADD or MODIFY template files for ITS OWN language's kinds and the ONE dispatch line that reaches each. It must **NEVER modify another language's template body or dispatch line.** (SNOBOL touches `bb_pat_*`; Prolog touches `bb_goal/arith/unify/cut/disj/conj/atom/struct/logicvar`; Icon touches `bb_every/alt/limit/scan/to/iterate/…`.)

4. **BYTES LIVE ONLY IN TEMPLATES — A MISSING BOX FALLS LOUD.** FORBIDDEN outside a template fn: `seg_byte(SEG_CODE`, `SL_B(`, `sl_emit_one`, `emit_standard_blob`, and the raw byte-producers `bytes()/u8()/u32le()/u64le()` (allowed only in `bomb_bytes`/`bb_emit_asm_result` of `emit_str.cpp`). A kind with no template yet must hit the dispatch's loud default (assert/abort), never silently emit nothing or fall through. `scripts/util_template_purity_audit.sh` is the standing guard.

5. **THE SHARED SOURCE LIST IS ADDITIVE; BUILD/ABI CHANGES ARE LOCKSTEP.** The Makefile `RT_PIC_SRCS` template list is APPEND-ONLY — add your new `.cpp` on its own line at the end of the language's group (one line = one hunk, no conflict). ADDING a template + its source line + its dispatch case is free. CHANGING a shared emitter primitive (`emit_core` dispatch signature, `BB_t`/`IR_t` layout, the `operand_aux` sidecar API, register-frame ABI) affects all three → it MUST update all three GOAL files' FACT RULE in the SAME commit and re-prove all three.

6. **THE EMITTER GATES ARE THE SHARED GREEN SIGNAL.** Before every commit: `scripts/util_template_purity_audit.sh` (no bytes outside templates), `scripts/test_gate_em_template_byte_identity.sh` + `scripts/test_gate_em_template_matrix.sh` (templates emit the sanctioned bytes), and the per-language no-stack/one-reg gates (`test_gate_icn_no_stack.sh`, `test_gate_icn_one_reg_frame.sh`) must stay green. Green = your box emits right AND you didn't disturb a peer.

**COMPLETION TEST:** (a) no duplicated `case IR_` label in `emit_core.c` (`grep -oE 'case IR_[A-Z_]+' src/emitter/emit_core.c | sort | uniq -d` empty); (b) every `IR_*` kind a language emits has exactly one dispatch case reaching one template fn, unmatched kinds hit the loud default; (c) zero forbidden byte-emitters outside templates (`util_template_purity_audit.sh` clean); (d) the FACT RULE body is byte-identical across the three GOAL files (`awk '/TEMPLATE-ONLY EMISSION — ONE-DISPATCH/{p=1} p{print} /util_template_purity_audit.sh clean/{if(p)exit}'` md5 matches); (e) the emitter gates above are green.

## ⛔ X86-64 REGISTER / SUBJECT-MODEL CONVENTION (FACT — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md)

Locked callee-saved layout the three concurrent BB sessions MUST share (canonical origin: GOAL-ICON-BB "Subject model — four names, zero redundancy"; casing inherited from the snobol4jvm Clojure SNOBOL4). **Casing carries meaning: UPPERCASE = the fixed whole/bound; lowercase = the moving position.**

| Reg | Class | Name | Role |
|-----|-------|------|------|
| **R13** | callee-saved | **Σ** (UPPER) | subject BASE ptr — the fixed whole string |
| **R14** | callee-saved | **δ** (lower) | CURSOR — the moving scan position |
| **R15** | callee-saved | **Δ** (UPPER) | subject LENGTH/END — the fixed bound |
| (scratch) | — | **σ** (lower) | TRANSIENT current-char ptr `Σ+δ`, computed at deref, NOT durable |
| **R12** | callee-saved | **ζ** (zeta) | BB-local RW FRAME base; every box-local is `[r12+off]` (RATIFIED 2026-05-30) |
| **R10** | caller-saved | LOCAL | per-BLOB DATA-block ptr (`lea r10,[rip+Δ_data]`); constant inside a BLOB |
| **rbx** | callee-saved | — | FREE / callee-saved scratch (preserved across the box chain) |
| **rbp** | callee-saved | — | DEFINE'd / brokered function frame ptr when active (`push rbp;mov rbp,rsp`); else callee-saved scratch |

**γ-success return packing:** `rax = σ ptr`, `rdx = δ int` (spec_t).

**RETIREMENT (all three sessions must honor):** the old **`Ω`** (omega — mode-2 `refs/bb/test_*.c` oracle) and **`Σlen`** (mode-3/4 `bb_pat_*.cpp` templates) are ONE quantity under two names → **both fold into `Δ`**; always moved in lockstep. Rename sweep: `Δ(old cursor)→δ`, `Ω→Δ`, `Σlen→Δ`. Substring nesting is held on the C stack (`save_Σ`/`save_Σlen`), so ONE length register suffices. **Pre-flight gate before deleting a name:** grep that no path ever sets `Σlen ≠ Ω`. Changing any assignment in this table is LOCKSTEP — update all three GOAL files in the SAME commit (mirrors the SHARED-LOWERER / EMITTER FACT RULES).

## 🧹 #1 — GROUND ZERO COMMENT & BLANK-LINE PURGE — DONE 2026-05-31

**First-place task this session (Lon).** Every hand-written `.c/.h/.y/.l` file under `SCRIP/src`
had **all** C-style (`/* */`) and C++-style (`//`) comments stripped, **all blank lines deleted**,
and a **200-char `/*----…----*/` separator** inserted between functions and at top-level
partitions. Rationale: a comment is wrong the moment after it is written because it is never
rewritten when its referent changes — at ground zero we carry **zero** stale comments to confuse us.
- **187 files, 72,442 → 60,455 lines.** Stripper is string/char-literal aware (`"http://"`, `'/'`,
  `"//"` operators all survive). Seed intact: `scrip --interp` prints `hello`. Build green.
- **EXCLUDED — do NOT strip these (they break the build / are machine output):** the 12 checked-in
  flex/bison generated files compiled directly by the Makefile — `*.lex.c`, `*.tab.c`, `*.tab.h`,
  `lex.*.c` under `src/frontend/*/`. Restored from HEAD after the purge.
- **`.cpp` NOT included** — Lon's spec named C/H/Y/L only. `src/emitter/**/*.cpp` still carry their
  comments; extend the purge to `.cpp` if desired (same stripper, add the extension).
- Naming: the icn-derived `gen_` rascal strip (prefix + `g_gen_*`/`lower_gen_*`/`rt_gen_*` infixes,
  e.g. `g_gen_frame_active → g_frame_active`) landed in the same Ground Zero pass; genuine generator
  tokens (the 7 pre-existing `gen_*`, `bb_gen_scan/alt`, `BB_GEN_*`, `binop_gen_state_t`) preserved.

## ⛔⛔ GROUND ZERO 3 — STACKLESS REBUILD (Reset 2026-05-30) ⛔⛔

**This is the THIRD ground-zero reset. The premise that was wrong both prior times: a value stack.**

There is NO value stack. Not an SM value stack, not a `vstack`, not `r12`-as-TOS, not
`rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*` for Icon value flow. A complete stackless static SNOBOL4/Icon BB
emitter existed ~1.5–2 months ago (archived at `SCRIP/archive/backend/emit_emitters/emit_x64.c`)
and benchmarked **faster than SPITBOL precisely because there is no stack**. The current
mode-3 Icon path regressed by making an SM value stack the inter-box value mechanism
(`rt_push_int` ×39, `rt_pop_nv_set` ×21, underflow guard in `rt.c`). GROUND ZERO 3 rebuilds
from `write("hello")` upward on the stackless model and never reintroduces the value stack.

**The stackless model (verbatim from the archive + the references):**
- **Values live in flat per-box DATA slots**, addressed at stable emit-time addresses
  (the existing `&pBB->value` / `&pBB->counter` / `&pBB->state` idiom). `emit_x64.c:10` —
  *"All pattern variables live flat in .bss as QWORD (resq 1) slots."*
- **Value flow is static wiring, not push/pop.** A box writes its result into its OWN slot;
  a consumer reads its operand boxes' slots directly (operands are known at emit time via
  α/β). Proebsting `plus`: `plus.value ← E1.value + E2.value` — read children by name.
- **Backtrack state for unbounded depth = a per-box .bss ARENA**, not a global stack. ARBNO
  (`emit_arbno`, `emit_x64.c:932`) and recursion use a per-box frame array indexed by depth
  (`test_sno_1.c` `_1[64]`; `test_sno_3.c` lazy `enter()/ζζ` heap frame). NOT push/pop.
- **Inter-box transitions are direct `jmp`.** No `call`/`ret`, no dispatch loop, no walker.
- The hardware C stack (`rsp`) may be used ONLY as transient scratch inside a single node
  (e.g. protect an arithmetic operand across a nested sub-eval, as the archive does) — never
  to thread values between boxes.

**References (now in-repo at `SCRIP/refs/bb/`):**
- `Proebsting-Simple-Translation-of-Goal-Directed-Evaluation.pdf` — the four-port templates
  (literal N §4.1, uminus §4.2, plus §4.3, LessThan §4.3, to §4.4, ifstmt §4.5). Figure 1/2
  are the exact target for `5 > ((1 to 2) * (3 to 4))`.
- `test_icon.c` — that same expression as flat C goto-graph, named-slot values, ZERO stacks.
  The byte-exact structural target for GZ-1..GZ-6.
- `test_sno_1.c` — SNOBOL4 ARBNO over alternation: the per-box `_1[64]` arena (the only stack).
- `test_sno_2.c` — recursion as four-port functions (`group`→`group`), `_λ` landing pads.
- `test_sno_3.c` — **the EVAL/CODE/`*P` deferred solution**: each deferred sub-pattern is a
  four-port function `str_t E(E_t **ζζ, int entry)`, frame lazily `calloc`'d by `enter()`,
  resumable at α/β, `empty` decoded as failure at `_λ`. This is the model for GZ-DEFER.
- `SCRIP/archive/backend/emit_emitters/emit_x64.c` — the prior working stackless emitter.

**NEW GATE (enforces stacklessness, parallel to the FACT gate):**
```bash
# Icon emission path must contain ZERO value-stack push/pop:
grep -rnoE 'rt_(push|pop)_[a-z_]+' src/emitter/BB_templates/ src/emitter/emit_bb.c \
  | grep -v _pl_ | wc -l        # target: 0 for every Icon box family as it is rebuilt
```
Plus the existing per-rung gate: `m2==m3` byte-identical, `--dump-sm` count=0 (zero SM),
FACT 0, smokes hold.

### ⛔ ALWAYS TEST ALL THREE MODES (Icon GOAL policy — set 2026-05-31)

**Every SCRIP execution test for this GOAL runs the program through ALL THREE modes on the SAME source, and reports all three. Never test fewer than all three.**

#### ★ THREE-MODE SESSION-SYNC STEPPING (adopted 2026-06-01 from GOAL-PROLOG-BB, Lon directive) ★

**Icon now follows the Prolog discipline: every gate run loops the corpus through interp/run/compile and the THREE columns are tracked side-by-side. A rung is not "done" until all three are accounted for — m2 PASS, AND m3+m4 each either PASS or LOUDLY EXCISE (never a silent miscompile).**

- **THE THREE-MODE HARNESS:** `scripts/test_icon_rung_suite.sh [--rung R] [--mode all|interp|run|compile]` (DEFAULT `--mode all`) is the Icon twin of `test_prolog_rung_suite.sh`. It runs each corpus program in all three engine paths against `.expected` and prints one summary line per mode. `test_icon_all_rungs.sh` remains the mode-2-only category-tally view (rung36 breakdown); the new suite is the THREE-MODE source of truth.
- **THE `[SMX]` LOUD-DECLINE MECHANISM (the linchpin, identical to Prolog):** the Icon mode-3/4 driver arms call `icn_graph_native_emittable(s2)` BEFORE emitting. A graph containing a kind whose native template is still a STUB (emits zero bytes) makes the driver print `[SMX] ... EXCISED` to stderr and decline cleanly (exit 0, no output). The harness reads `[SMX]` as **EXCISED — expected mid-Ground-Zero, NOT a FAIL**. This is the same law as the FACT rules' "A MISSING BOX FALLS LOUD, NEVER SILENT": before this, a stubbed box (e.g. `bb_gen_scan`) emitted nothing and the program ran to a silent-wrong (empty) result that no harness caught. Now it EXCISES loudly and is tracked. Current loud-decline kind list (`icn_kind_native_stub` in `scrip.c`): `IR_GEN_SCAN`, `IR_GEN_ALT`, `IR_KEYWORD`, `IR_PROC_GEN`, `IR_CSET_*`, `IR_SUSPEND`. **REMOVE a kind from that list the moment its real MEDIUM_TEXT+MEDIUM_BINARY arm lands — that is what lights the mode up for the family.**
  - **⚠️ LESSON (2026-06-01, verified empirically — do NOT repeat): ONLY genuine single-purpose zero-byte-template kinds may go on this blanket list.** A MUXED kind — one IR enum carrying several operations via `ival` — must NEVER be blanket-declined: `IR_UNOP` muxes unary-minus (native arm broken → silent FAIL) WITH `*s` size / `!s` bang-iterate / `\x` nonnull (native arms WORK, some m3-PASS); `IR_BINOP` muxes `1+2` (works) WITH generator cross-products `(1 to 2)*(3 to 4)` (aborts `[GZ-3] FATAL bb_call`). Adding `IR_UNOP` to the list cost a real m3-PASS (13→12) by wrongly excising rung12 `*s`; reverted. The non-working operations inside a muxed kind, and composition-specific aborts, need a PER-OPERATION or PER-COMPOSITION decline (finer than a kind check) or the actual native arm — that is GZ-11+ work, not a blanket entry here.
- **COMPLETION BAR per rung (the new "done"):** (1) mode-2 all-PASS (HARD GATE, the oracle); (2) mode-3 PASS **or** EXCISED — never a silent FAIL; (3) mode-4 PASS **or** EXCISED. A rung that is mode-2-only declares its m3/m4 EXCISED *loudly* (via the stub list) so the gap is visible and tracked, not hidden. Driving an EXCISED family to PASS = writing its stackless native template (the GZ-11+ work).
- **HONEST THREE-MODE BASELINE (2026-06-01, post-scan + post-discipline):** `test_icon_rung_suite.sh` full corpus — **m2 (interp) 127 PASS / 120 FAIL / 36 XFAIL**; **m3 (run) 13 PASS / 212 FAIL / 22 EXCISED**; **m4 (compile) 11 PASS / 214 FAIL / 22 EXCISED**. The m2 number matches `test_icon_all_rungs.sh`. The m3/m4 FAILs are the previously-INVISIBLE native gaps now surfaced: most are partial/stubbed templates that do not yet print `[SMX]` (silent-wrong); they are the GZ-11+ ratchet targets. Many of those FAILs SHOULD become EXCISED as their stubbed kinds are added to `icn_kind_native_stub` (the loud-decline sweep — a follow-up task: classify each m3-FAIL as silent-nothing→add-to-stub-list vs genuinely-fixable-arm).

- **mode 2 — `--interp`** (BB port-walker oracle) — **HARD GATE**: must be all-PASS (the source-of-truth output; build sanity).
- **mode 3 — `--run`** (stackless native x86) — **TRACKED**: floor `MODE3_MIN` (env, default 1), ratchets up as GZ rungs rebuild each box family stackless.
- **mode 4 — `--compile`** (standalone x86-64 asm → assemble with `gcc -no-pie` → link `out/libscrip_rt.so` → run → compare output) — **TRACKED**: floor `MODE4_MIN` (env, default 0). **REBUILT 2026-05-31 (Sonnet 4.5): Icon smoke m4 0/6 → 5/6 (matches m3).** No longer severed for Icon — `--compile` emits a C-ABI `main` wrapper (`rt_frame`→ζ, esi=0 → `call main_α`) + the flat BB body via `codegen_flat_build`, reusing the SAME BB templates mode-3 emits (mode-3 = `MEDIUM_BINARY` into a pool + `jmp`; mode-4 = `MEDIUM_TEXT` GAS asm). Non-Icon `--compile` still stubs loud (not yet crossed). (GZ-8, 2026-05-31: `if_expr` — previously the lone m4/m3-red case, fork-blocked in the ring→tree adapter — is now GREEN in m3 AND m4 via the flat-chain relop-as-branch; Icon smoke m2/m3/m4 = **6/6/6**, the first all-three-modes pass.) A new GZ rung is not "done" until its mode-2 oracle is green AND mode-3 + mode-4 are tracked against it.
- **Canonical harnesses already wired for all three:** `scripts/test_smoke_icon.sh` (per-frontend gate) and `scripts/test_crosscheck_icon.sh` (mode-consistency). Any NEW or edited Icon test script MUST run `--interp`, `--run`, AND `--compile` (mode-4 via the asm→assemble→link→run path; if `out/libscrip_rt.so` is absent or `--compile` emits nothing, mode-4 simply fails/tracks — never silently skipped). The per-rung `test_icon_ir_rung_*.sh` scripts are mode-2 oracle tests today; migrate each to all-three as it is next touched.
- **What "mode-3 == mode-4" means — the equivalence LEVEL (verified by disassembly 2026-05-31, Sonnet 4.8):** the two modes share the IDENTICAL codegen pipeline — `icn_flat_chain_build` (m3) and `icn_flat_chain_build_text` (m4) both call the SAME `codegen_flat_chain_body` → `walk_bb_flat` → templates; the ONLY fork is `emitter_init_binary` vs `emitter_init_text`, which selects the `MEDIUM_BINARY` vs `MEDIUM_TEXT` arm *per instruction*. Slot allocation (`bb_slot_alloc16`/`bb_varslot`), the operand-ref DFS, and the γ/ω branch wiring are all medium-independent → IDENTICAL instruction stream (same mnemonics, operands, order, control flow) and IDENTICAL slot offsets. **The maintained bar is codegen-path + instruction + behavioral parity** (exactly what `test_crosscheck_icon.sh` checks: `--compile agrees`). It is **NOT byte-identical machine code, and never has been**: the `MEDIUM_TEXT` arm emits mnemonic asm and lets `gas` relax in-range jumps to short rel8 (`eb`/`7x`), while `MEDIUM_BINARY` hand-encodes every jump as near rel32 (`E9`/`0F 8x` + 4 bytes). Census on `if x>5 then write("big") else write("small")`: assembled m4 `.text` = **16 short + 2 near**; m3 slab = **all 18 near**. This near-vs-short divergence is PERVASIVE — present in every box (LIT_I/VAR/CALL/relop alike), a property of the text backend, not a per-rung bug; GZ-8 introduced none of it (its relop's BINARY opcode byte and TEXT mnemonic both come from the one `gen_rel_fail_jcc` switch, so they cannot drift). **When verifying a rung's m3≡m4, compare the disassembled INSTRUCTION stream + behavior, not raw bytes.** TRUE byte-identity (if ever required) would need a branch-relaxation pass in the BINARY emitter (choose short rel8 when the target is in range) OR `.byte`-level emission in the TEXT arm — a SHARED-emitter change across all three languages (lockstep per the TEMPLATE-ONLY FACT RULE); tracked here, not scheduled.
- Mode-4 needs `out/libscrip_rt.so` (`make libscrip_rt`) and `gcc`; the harnesses degrade gracefully (mode-4 FAIL/TRACK) when either is missing so the mode-2 HARD gate still runs in any environment.

### Rung ladder (HELLO WORLD up — each gated, stackless, no `rt_push`/`rt_pop`)

- [x] **GZ-0 — Scaffold + gates.** DONE — no-stack gate pinned; slot/arena conventions grounded in archived `emit_arbno` + `test_icon.c`.
- [x] **GZ-1 — `write("hello")`.** DONE m2/m3 — RO string sealed in-blob, read `lea rdi,[rip+disp]` + `rt_write_str_nl`, no push.
- [x] **GZ-2 — `write(42)`.** DONE m2/m3 — literal int sealed RO, read `[rip+disp]` (no patch/abs/stack).
- [x] **GZ-3 — `write(1+2)`.** DONE m2/m3/m4 — stackless int binop; operands baked RO `[rip+disp]`, result `[r12+off]`. (Mode-3 ring→tree adapter `icn_ring_to_tree` + Icon epilogue r10 fix landed same rung.)
- [x] **GZ-4 — `every write(1 to 3)`.** DONE m2/m3/m4 — `to` pump stackless; lo/hi sealed RO, cursor `[r12+off]`.
- [x] **GZ-5 — `every write(1|2|3)`.** DONE m2 — alt fail-chain self-drives via the IR_ALT collector + EVERY terminator. (m3/m4 alt = later fork-gated rung.)
- [x] **GZ-6 — `every write(5 > ((1 to 2)*(3 to 4)))`.** DONE m2 — nested-generator self-drive, paper Fig 1 (seam `g_icn_postfix_resume`, mode-2 only).
- [x] **GZ-7 — `x := 42; write(x)`.** DONE m2/m3/m4 — flat named-slot var (`bb_varslot`), no ring/stack; `icn_flat_chain_build` two-pass emitter.
- [x] **GZ-8 — `if`/relop control.** DONE m2/m3/m4 — relop routes its OWN γ/ω (cmp+jcc, negated relation), IR_IF vestigial. No LAST_OK/BB_IF/vstack.
- [x] **GZ-9 — `while`/`until`/`repeat` + `break`/`next`.** DONE m2/m3/m4 — Model B self-driving loops (loop node = forwarder/terminator; cond relop + body γ/ω carry the loop).
- [x] **GZ-10 — user procedure as a four-port FLAT box.** DONE m2/m3/m4 — `(ζζ,entry)` convention; args + recursion + mutual recursion; per-activation depth-indexed frame arena (NOT a value stack); `lower_sc` param capture; bare-`if`-no-else fall-through fixed.
- [x] **GZ-11 SUSPEND — user generators via `suspend E do BODY`** (jcon `ir_a_Suspend`). DONE m2 ORACLE — eager-drain `SuspendBuf` + node-keyed `susp_gen_cache`, `is_generator` pre-pass wires a generator call β→self. Native m3/m4 suspend = later rung.
- [x] **GZ-SCAN — Icon string scanning `subj ? body`** (jcon `ir_a_Scan`; runtime `bscan`/`escan` in `imisc.r`). DONE m2 ORACLE (2026-06-01, Opus 4.8) — `v_scan` Icon arm builds `IR_GEN_SCAN` (subject→`counter` subgraph, body→`ival` subgraph, `dval=1.0`); the `IR_GEN_SCAN` dval==1.0 exec arm coerces subject→string, saves/sets(`&pos:=1`)/restores `&subject`+`&pos` via the `scan_stack` (the oracle's save/restore idiom — NOT a value stack), runs the body subgraph; restore-on-body-success and restore-on-body-failure both correct (nested-scan test verifies outer subject returns). **Fix that unlocked it:** `bb_reset` was zeroing `IR_GEN_SCAN->counter` (the subject-subgraph ptr) — added to the counter-preservation allowlist (`scrip_ir.c`), mirroring IR_SCAN/IR_SUSPEND. **corpus m2 114→127** (+13: rung05 scan ×5, rung06 cset-scan `any`/`many`/`upto` ×5, rung08 string-scan `match`/`move`/`tab` ×3). **Native m3/m4 scan = later rung — now LOUDLY EXCISES** (`IR_GEN_SCAN` in `icn_kind_native_stub`).
- [ ] **GZ-DEFER — EVAL / CODE / `*P` deferred patterns** via the `test_sno_3.c` model. This was
  the ONE thing that broke the prior stackless build; it is solved in the reference file.
- [ ] **GZ-11+ — corpus features rebuilt stackless** (lists, tables, records, scanning, csets,
  builtins, sort, ...). Each: read the canonical JCON/Icon source first, then a flat slot/arena
  template, gated m2==m3 + zero-SM + no-stack=0 + no corpus regression.
  - [x] **GZ-11+ chain-entry sentinel + unary-minus + slot-concat** (2026-06-01, Opus 4.8, SCRIP `10f6863`) — `write(-x)`/`write(+x)` (stackless `bb_unop` slot→slot DESCR), `write(s||" w")`/`write(a||b||"!")` (stackless slot-based `BINOP_CONCAT`), and the foundational chain-entry prelude-sentinel fix (a `local`/`static` decl prepends `IR_SUCCEED` sentinels both flat-chain walkers were dropping). All m2==m3==m4. corpus m3 13→21, m4 1→19. See watermark.
  - [ ] remaining GZ-11+ families: `not`/`size`/`nonnull` stackless `bb_unop`; real-arith binops; generator-operand binops (Fig-1 native m3/m4); `rt_call_builtin` (find/upto/many/any).

## ⛔ PER-BOX LOCAL STORAGE — ALL STATE LIVES INSIDE THE BOXES (FACT RULE — byte-identical in GOAL-SNOBOL4-BB.md, GOAL-ICON-BB.md, GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md)

**ONLY local BB allocation variables are used; NOTHING is stored outside the boxes.** Every value a
SNOBOL4 (or Icon / Prolog) BB graph computes or holds at run time lives in storage that belongs to a
box — never in any external/global side channel. There is NO AG ring at run time (the ring is the
MODE-2 ORACLE's idiom ONLY — `bb_exec_once`), NO value stack (`g_vstack`/`rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*`), and
intermediate values are NOT threaded through the global name table (`NV_GET`/`NV_SET`) — name-table
stores are reserved for genuine SNOBOL4 *variables* on assignment, not for passing a value from a
producer box to its consumer.

**Each box owns exactly two kinds of local allocation, both INSIDE the box (not outside):**
- **READ-ONLY data (RO)** — compile-time constants for that box (literal int/real/string/cset values,
  the box's name string, fixed bounds, op codes). Placed in the SEALED segment adjacent to the box's
  BLOB and reached by IP-relative addressing (`lea/mov reg,[rip+disp]`, `disp` an emit-time constant in
  the BINARY arm; a `.L`-label in the TEXT arm). RO data is NEVER threaded on a stack and NEVER reached
  by an absolute `movabs … &slot` immediate.
- **READ-WRITE data (RW)** — the box's mutable runtime storage (its result value/DESCR slot, counters,
  cursors, per-box backtrack arenas, generator state). Lives in the per-sequence ONE-REGISTER FRAME and
  is reached register-relative `[ζ=r12 + emit_time_offset]`. A consumer reads a producer box's result by
  that producer's frame offset (`bb_slot_get`/`bb_slot_alloc`); a SNOBOL4/Icon *variable* is ONE
  name-keyed frame slot (`bb_varslot`) shared by its IR_ASSIGN(name) writer and IR_VAR(name) readers.

So every box value reference is exactly one of: **(RO)** `[rip+disp]` into sealed data, or **(RW)**
`[ζ+off]` into the per-sequence frame. Never a ring, never a value stack, never a name-table round-trip
for an intermediate. This is the `test_sno_1.c` / `test_icon.c` named-slot law the GZ-7 Icon and PLG-8
Prolog siblings already follow (`febef10`: `x:=42;write(x)` → m2==m3==m4, all slot-based, no ring).

**COMPLETION TEST (per box family):** (a) no `bb_exec_once`/AG-ring read or write on the mode-3/4 run
path; (b) no `g_vstack`/`rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*`; (c) no `NV_GET`/`NV_SET` used to carry an *intermediate*
producer→consumer value (only true variable assignment); (d) every box-local read is `[rip+disp]` (RO)
or `[ζ+off]` (RW) — no `movabs … &pBB->slot` absolute slot address; (e) mode-3 BINARY arm and mode-4
TEXT arm of the SAME box do the SAME processing (the only diff is BINARY-bytes vs GAS-text).

---

**Reset:** 2026-05-30 (GROUND ZERO 3). All prior IBB-* rungs (the two vstack-based builds) removed
from this file — they were the regression, not a foundation. The build now starts again from
`write("hello")` on the stackless model. Demolition of the Icon value-stack consumers is the first
step (see Watermark).

## Premise

Icon IS a Byrd Box graph. Every construct is a box. The whole program is one connected port-graph. **There is no SM around it at all.** **There is no value stack.**

- Mode 2: driver detects Icon and calls `bb_exec_once(s2->sm.bb_table[main_bb_idx])` directly. `sm_interp_run` is never entered. Icon SM stream is empty.
- Modes 3/4: emit `lea r10, [rip + Δ_root]; jmp .Lroot_α`. `SM_HALT`. Boxes are CODE+DATA in `bb_pool` (mode 3) or in the linked binary's `.text`/`.data` (mode 4). Inter-box transitions are `jmp rel32`. No `call`, no `ret`, no SM dispatch loop, no broker, no C walker in mode-4, **no `rt_push`/`rt_pop` value-stack traffic**.

Per `test_icon.c`: every construct gets `_start` / `_resume` / `_succeed` / `_fail` labels wired by flat `goto`, and every value lives in a named per-box slot read directly by its consumer. Three-column form: `LABEL / ACTION / GOTO`. That is the target shape.

---

## ⛔ GOAL RULE (Icon SM streams)

**ZERO SM opcodes emitted for an Icon program.** No `SM_BB_INVOKE`, no `SM_HALT`, no `SM_CALL_FN`, nothing. Driver calls `bb_exec_once(main_bb_graph)` directly.

Completion tests:
```bash
./scrip --dump-sm any_icon_program.icn        # ; SM_sequence_t  count=0
./scrip --dump-sm any_icon_program.icn | grep -c '^   [0-9]'   # 0
```

## ⛔ CONSULT CANONICAL SOURCES (JCON + Icon)

**Every time a question arises during new SM/BB or feature work — port topology, resume/backtrack wiring, builtin semantics — `grep`/read the relevant canonical procedure FIRST and ground the implementation in it.** Do NOT assume; you do not know until you check. Authority: `refs/jcon-master/tran/irgen.icn` (`ir_a_Every`, `ir_a_Limitation`, `ir_a_Call`, `ir_a_Alt`, … define control-flow/ports) and `refs/icon-master/src/runtime/*.r` (`fstranl.r`, `ocomp.r`, `fscan.r`, … define runtime/builtin semantics). The mode-2 oracle `bb_exec.c` is a transcription, not the source of truth — when they disagree, the canonical source wins. Full statement in `RULES.md`. (Extract the uploaded `icon-master.zip` / `jcon-master.zip` into `refs/` at session start if not present.)

## DO NOT

- Touch SNOBOL4 / Snocone / Rebus / Raku / Prolog lower or BB families. **They keep their SM and their value stack (`g_vstack`). The stack removal is Icon-only.**
- Use `SM_BB_INVOKE` for Icon programs going through `lower_icn_bb`.
- Write `DESCR_t foo(void *zeta, int entry)` C Byrd box functions. See `GOAL-ICON-BB-NATIVE.md`.
- Add fields to `BB_t`.
- Walk SM or BB at runtime in modes 3/4.
- Reintroduce the value stack for Icon value flow in any form (SM vstack, `vstack`, `r12`-as-TOS, `rt_push_*`/`rt_pop_*`).

## RATIFIED — UNIFIED REGISTER LAYOUT (2026-05-30, session 3)

**Context (2026-05-30):** Icon is *not* in proper development yet — GROUND ZERO 3 only started scaffolding (GZ-0/1/2), not real development. Before going further we designed AND RATIFIED ONE x86-64 register layout for all 6 languages (this session). The layout below is grounded in the archive + live code and is now the reference all rungs build against; nothing is emitted onto it yet (first rung = R-HW below).

**The standardized floor is System V AMD64.** Caller-saved/scratch (9): RAX(ret), RCX/RDX/RSI/RDI/R8/R9(args), R10(static-chain), R11(PLT). Callee-saved (7): RBX, RBP(frame ptr), RSP(stack ptr), R12, R13, R14, R15. Int-arg order RDI,RSI,RDX,RCX,R8,R9; return RAX(+RDX). Claimable durable globals = RBX,R12,R13,R14,R15 (+RBP if -fomit-frame-pointer).

**Core principle:** anything that must live across a C `call` (our global-type pointers) goes in a CALLEE-SAVED register, so it survives every `rt_*` call with NO per-call save/restore. The only save is once, at a cross-language boundary. Today SNOBOL4's cursor is in caller-saved R10 (`&Δ`) → it pays a `push r10`/`pop r10` tax on every call; moving it to a callee-saved reg deletes that tax.

**Two kinds of BB locals, two bases (this is the existing convention, NOT new):**
- READ-WRITE locals → `[R12 + off]`. R12 is the BB-local frame base (Technique-2 / `M-T2-EMIT-SPLIT`: "r12 = DATA-block ptr; all locals [r12+offset]"). The ARBNO arena (`z`/`zo`), capture `saved_Δ`, Icon runtime values all live here. (NOTE: the Icon frame was wrongly wired to R15 this session — it must move to R12 to rejoin the convention. Also: live SNOBOL4 `BB_PAT_*` regressed to per-slot `movabs rcx,<abs>` and must come back to `[r12+off]`.)
- READ-ONLY locals → `[RIP + disp]` from the sealed blob (literals, baked addresses). No register.

**RATIFIED durable register layout — six callee-saved registers carry durable state. They survive every `rt_*` call via the SysV ABI; saved once at the cross-language boundary, never per-call:**
| reg | durable role | who |
|---|---|---|
| R12 | ζ — BB-local RW frame base, `[r12+off]` | all langs |
| R13 | Σ — subject base pointer (UPPERCASE = the fixed whole string) | pattern langs (SNOBOL4, Icon scan); free otherwise |
| R14 | δ — subject cursor / current offset (lowercase = the moving position) | pattern langs; free otherwise |
| R15 | Δ — subject length / end offset (UPPERCASE = the bound) | pattern langs; free otherwise |
| RBX | NV / globals base (named-value table) | all langs |
| RBP | RESERVED — untouched. The sixth durable reg ONLY if needed. Claimed (if ever) by NOT emitting a frame-pointer prologue — NOT by any compiler flag (the ABI makes RBP callee-saved unconditionally; `-fomit-frame-pointer` only governs the C runtime's own use of RBP, irrelevant to ours). NEVER used for value flow. | — |

Transition note: SNOBOL4/Snocone/Rebus/Raku keep a value stack (`g_vstack`) only until BB-converted; being pattern or non-Icon, they park it in an unused one of R13/R14/R15 (or memory) during transition. Icon and Prolog have NO value stack. Goal: `g_vstack` retires entirely (the BB win — see Premise).

**Caller-saved — clobbered by every call; scratch / ABI transport ONLY, never durable:**
| reg | role |
|---|---|
| RAX (:RDX) | result / γ value (DESCR_t lo:hi) |
| RDI | inbound ζ transport → copied to R12, then scratch |
| RSI | scratch. (α/β entry selector RETIRED from the Icon flat-wired path — β is a `jmp` target there. Still consumed ONLY by the Prolog brokered re-entry — `pl_runtime.c` / `pl_broker.c` `fn(ζ,β)` — until those become wired `jmp`s; selector dies then.) |
| RCX, RDX, R8, R9, R10, R11 | rt_* args + scratch |
| RSP | C control stack — the ONE stack. Return addresses + transient per-node scratch ONLY; NO value flow between boxes. |

**Subject model — four names, zero redundancy.** Σ base ptr (R13) · σ transient `Σ+δ` (scratch, computed at deref, not durable) · δ cursor (R14) · Δ length/end (R15). Casing carries meaning: UPPERCASE = the fixed whole/bound (Σ, Δ); lowercase = the moving position (σ, δ). Convention inherited from the snobol4jvm Clojure SNOBOL4. **The old `Ω` and `Σlen` BOTH retire into Δ** — verified to be one quantity under two names: `Ω` in the mode-2 `refs/bb/test_*.c` oracle, `Σlen` in the mode-3/4 emitter templates (`bb_pat_*.cpp`), always moved in lockstep (`rt.c` rebase sets `Σlen = sublen; Ω = sublen` together; saved/restored together). Substring nesting is held on the C stack (`save_Σ`/`save_Σlen`), not in a second length register — so ONE length reg suffices. Rename sweep: `Δ(old=cursor)→δ`, `Ω→Δ`, fold `Σlen→Δ`. Touch points: `bb_box.h` (decls), `xa_flat.cpp`/`emit_bb.c`/`emit_globals.h` (`TEMPLATE_ADDR_DELTA`/`ADDR_SIGMA`/`TEMPLATE_ADDR_SIGLEN` macros, 63 `Σlen` sites), `refs/bb/*.c`. **Pre-flight gate before deleting a name:** grep that no path ever sets `Σlen ≠ Ω`.

**Long-lived global state (grounded, the register-cache candidates):** `g_vstack[VSTACK_CAP]` (DESCR_t value stack, rt.c) · `Σ/Δ/Ω/Σlen` (bb_box.h subject scan) · `NV_GET_fn/NV_SET_fn` (named-value table = global variables, by name-hash) · `DESCR_t` (16-byte universal value) · the per-sequence RW frame.

**C BB BOX DEMOLITION (forbidden by RULES line 11; exemption REVOKED — `icn_bb_dcg` is NOT exempt, strike that clause).** A C BB box = a C function that (a) switches on entry α/β AND (b) wires four ports (α/β/γ/ω) inside. Those must be deleted and rebuilt as emitted wired graphs. VERIFIED genuine four-port C boxes (α AND β entry switch + γ and ω labels wired inside) = exactly TWO: `bb_deferred_var` (SNOBOL4 deferred, stmt_exec.c — `entry==α goto DVAR_α; entry==β goto DVAR_β;` + DVAR_γ/ω, re-enters child_fn) and `pl_cat_fn` (Prolog seq, pl_broker.c — `entry==α goto CAT_α; goto CAT_β;` + left_γ/ω, right_γ/ω). Exhaustive scan: only stmt_exec.c + pl_broker.c hold any `(void*,int entry)` fn with both γ and ω labels. NOT boxes by the test: `pl_choice_fn`/`pl_chunk_fn` (switch α/β but NO γ/ω labels — value-returning); `pl_true/fail/builtin/unify/head_unify/cut/alt/deferred_env_fn`, `icn_bb_oneshot`, `icn_fail_box` (single-entry leaves/wrappers); `pl_bb_dcg`, `icn_bb_dcg` (α-only bb_exec_once drivers). The x86 α/β selector (`cmp esi,0; jne β` in XA_FLAT_PROLOGUE + XA_ENTRY_DISPATCH) is LIVE: it's how brokered boxes are re-entered at β from `stmt_exec.c`/`pl_runtime.c`. It can only be deleted after those re-entries become wired `jmp`s.

## RUNG R-HW — `write("hello world");` (first rung on the ratified layout)

**Program:** `/tmp/rung_hw.icn` containing exactly `write("hello world")`.

**What it is — the read-only-string-literal write box (the string analog of GZ-2's `write(42)`).**
`"hello world"` is a READ-ONLY constant: it lives in the SEALED segment next to the box's own
blob and is read `[rip+disp]` (emit-time displacement — no patch, no abs immediate, no stack).
The box loads it into `rdi` and calls `rt_write_str_nl`. Because the value is a constant, this
rung uses NONE of the durable registers — no frame (R12), no subject regs (Σ/δ/Δ), no value
stack (there is none, ever). It exercises ONLY: sealed-blob RO data + `[rip+disp]` read + one
`rt_*` call + the four-port shell (γ → halt; ω unreached). Deliberately the minimal rung, so the
ratified layout gets a clean, fully-gated first proof point.

**Relationship to GZ-1:** GZ-1 already landed `write("hello")` on the OLD R15-frame build. R-HW
re-grounds the string-write path as the FIRST rung of the *ratified* layout and re-confirms every
gate. The string-write path does not touch the frame register, so the R15→R12 frame migration is
ORTHOGONAL to it — R-HW should pass with no frame work. Frame work (R12 + slot allocation) begins
at the first rung carrying RW state (`x := …` / `write(1+2)`), NOT here.

### Steps (each independently gated)

- [ ] **R-HW-0 — Bake & verify layout.** Ratified register table + subject naming written into
  this file (DONE — see "RATIFIED — UNIFIED REGISTER LAYOUT" above). Run Session Setup
  (`build_scrip.sh`, the three smokes). Confirm `scripts/test_gate_icn_no_stack.sh` and
  `scripts/test_gate_icn_one_reg_frame.sh` exist and pass at their pinned ratchet. No code change.

- [ ] **R-HW-1 — Rung program + mode-2 oracle (HARD GATE).** Create `/tmp/rung_hw.icn`. Then
  `./scrip --interp /tmp/rung_hw.icn` ⇒ `hello world` + newline. Driver detects Icon and calls
  `bb_exec_once(main_bb)` directly; `sm_interp_run` is never entered. This output is the ORACLE
  the other modes must match byte-for-byte.

- [x] **R-HW-2 — Mode-3 stackless RO-string box.** DONE — `lea rdi,[rip+disp]` + `rt_write_str_nl`, no push (re-grounds GZ-1 on the ratified layout).
- [x] **R-HW-3 — Mode-4 parity.** DONE — `write("hello world")` assembles + links libscrip_rt + runs, byte-matches m2/m3 (C-ABI `main` wrapper + `codegen_flat_build` MEDIUM_TEXT).
- [ ] **R-HW-4 — Full gate sweep + smokes.** All per-rung gates green; `test_smoke_icon.sh`
  mode-2 6/6 (HARD) with mode-3 now including hello-world; `test_smoke_prolog.sh` 5/5;
  `test_smoke_unified_broker.sh` ≥35. Ratchets (no-stack, one-reg-frame) unmoved. This rung is
  the ratified-layout baseline; later rungs may only lower ratchets, never raise them.

**HEAD (SCRIP):** `10f6863` GZ-11+ Icon NATIVE m3/m4 — chain-entry sentinel fix + stackless unary-minus + slot-concat. 4 files (+146/−19): `emit_bb.c` (two walker fixes + `walk_bb_flat` IR_UNOP case + CONCAT FILL), `emit_core.c` (IR_UNOP dispatch), `bb_unop.cpp` (stackless arm), `bb_binop.cpp` (slot-concat arm). FIVE bugs, all stackless + template-only. corpus m3 13→21, m4 1→19.

**Done this session (Opus 4.8, 2026-06-01, second session) — five native-emit bugs fixed, m3+m4 only (m2 ORACLE untouched).** All grounded per CONSULT-CANONICAL-SOURCES in `refs/jcon-master/tran/irgen.icn` (`ir_a_Unop`: `-`/`+` ∈ `funcs` ⇒ single-result, resume fails) + `refs/icon-master/src/runtime/oarith.r` (`operator{1} - neg(x)`; `+x` = number coercion) + `ofncs.r` cat.

**(1) Chain-entry prelude-sentinel drop — THE foundational bug (`emit_bb.c`, BOTH walkers).** A `local`/`static` declaration makes the lowerer prepend one or more `IR_SUCCEED`/`IR_FAIL` PRELUDE sentinels as the graph ENTRY, with the real first box on `->γ` (`[6] IR_SUCCEED γ=5` for `local x; x:=42; write(x)`). `codegen_flat_chain_body`'s BFS and `icn_chain_operand_refs`'s postfix pass both treat SUCCEED/FAIL as chain TERMINATORS and `continue` WITHOUT following γ — so a sentinel ENTRY dropped the WHOLE chain (BFS `n=0` → silent-empty m3/m4; operand-ref `nc=0` → `IR_ASSIGN`/`IR_UNOP` `α` left NULL → loud `bb_assign`/`bb_unop` FATAL). FIX: advance `entry` forward through any run of leading prelude sentinels (γ non-NULL) to the first real box, in BOTH walkers; a terminal sentinel (γ==NULL) is left as-is so a genuinely-empty body still collects nothing. The GZ-7 watermark's `x:=42;write(x)` worked ONLY because without a `local` decl its entry was already a real node. This alone unblocked `write(x)`, `write(x+1)`, etc.

**(2) IR_UNOP mis-dispatched (`emit_core.c`).** `IR_UNOP` fell through to `bb_call` (grouped with `IR_AUGOP`/`IR_CALL`) → the unop node reached the call template (garbage `fn=''`/`narg`). Moved `IR_UNOP` to the `bb_unop` dispatch group.

**(3) IR_UNOP missing from `walk_bb_flat`.** The lowerer emits `IR_UNOP` (op in `ival`=raw `tree_e`), NOT the split `IR_NEG`/… kinds. Added a chain-aware `case IR_UNOP` (FILL under `g_icn_flat_chain` — operand already BFS-collected; legacy `flat_drive_unop` off-chain). Without it, `IR_UNOP` hit `walk_bb_flat`'s `default` (silent two-`jmp ω`).

**(4) bb_unop stackless GZ-11+ arm for `-x`/`+x` (`bb_unop.cpp`).** Mirrors the GZ-9 arith slot→slot DESCR arm: reads the operand int payload `[r12+sa+8]` (`bb_slot_get(pBB->α)`), `neg rax` (TT_MNS) or pass-through (TT_PLS), writes a `{DT_I,result}` DESCR to its own `bb_slot_alloc16` slot; consumer reads via the GZ-7 `write(operand)` DESCR arm. The legacy `rt_unop_*` vstack helpers (which abort) are NOT called. Caught + fixed a byte-offset bug: ONE operand `mov` = 8 bytes, not GZ-9's 16 (`p_jmpg = 8+L+12+8`). SIZE/NONNULL/NOT still hit the legacy arm (their own later rung).

**(5) Variable-operand concat (`bb_binop.cpp` + `emit_bb.c`).** Added a stackless slot-based `BINOP_CONCAT` arm (general case of GZ-4's RO-literal arm): load both operand DESCRs from slots (a→rdi:rsi, b→rdx:rcx), `str_concat_d` by value, store result DESCR to own slot — handles `s||" w"` and chained `a||b||"!"` (inner concat is itself a slot producer). ALSO added `BINOP_CONCAT` to `walk_bb_flat`'s flat-chain FILL-only condition (was: rel/arith only) — concat was falling to `flat_drive_binop_tree`, which RE-WALKED the BFS-collected operands → in mode-4 TEXT that double-defined their `bb<id>_α` labels (assembler error). FILL-only fixes m4.

**HONEST THREE-MODE BASELINE (`test_icon_rung_suite.sh` full corpus, 2026-06-01):** **m2 (interp) 127 PASS / 120 FAIL / 36 XFAIL** (held — ORACLE untouched) · **m3 (run) 21 PASS / 204 FAIL / 22 EXCISED** (was 13) · **m4 (compile) 19 PASS / 206 FAIL / 22 EXCISED** (was 1; partly the `out/libscrip_rt.so` build, absent at session start). `write(-x)`, `write(s||" world")`, `write(a||b||"!")` all agree byte-for-byte across all three modes.

**LOUD-DECLINE-SWEEP DIAGNOSTIC (the GOAL NEXT — data gathered, not yet executed):** categorized every m3 FAIL where m2 PASSES → **87 abort-LOUD · 3 silent-EMPTY · 1 WRONG**. The codebase is already overwhelmingly loud; the silent-nothing EXCISE targets are just **3**: `rung07_control_repeat_break`, `rung13_alt_alt_int`, `rung13_alt_alt_every_write` (+1 WRONG: `rung03_suspend_fail` exp `1|3` got `1|2`). The bulk of remaining work is FAIL→PASS template arms, dominated by: **generator-operand binops** (the `every write(N < (1 to N)*…)` Proebsting Fig-1 cluster, ~the 23 `write(binop) slot-miss` aborts — explicitly a "later fork-gated rung"), **`rt_call_builtin`** (find/upto/etc., ~20, a bigger rung), and **richer `bb_assign` operand-ref shapes** (~14).

**GATES (all green, verified post-build):** Icon smoke **m2 12/12 · m3 12/12 · m4 12/12** (m4 now green with `out/libscrip_rt.so` built via `make libscrip_rt`) · Prolog smoke **m2 5/5 · m3 5/5 · m4 5/5** · corpus `test_icon_all_rungs` **127 PASS** · broker **25** · SNOBOL4 `hello` OK · FACT **0** · C-byrd-box **0** · g_vstack **0** · no-stack **117≤127** · one-reg-frame **20≤20** · prove_lower2 **green** · crosscheck-icon **4/0** · dup-IR-dispatch-labels **0**.

**COMMITTED SCRIP `10f6863`** (this `.github` commit lands the watermark). Files touched: `src/emitter/emit_bb.c`, `src/emitter/emit_core.c`, `src/emitter/BB_templates/bb_unop.cpp`, `src/emitter/BB_templates/bb_binop.cpp`, `.github/GOAL-ICON-BB.md`. Commit identity per RULES.md: `LCherryholmes <lcherryh@yahoo.com>`.

**NEXT:** (a) the 3-case loud-decline EXCISE to make the board fully honest (zero silent FAIL); (b) `not`/`size`/`nonnull`/`null_test` stackless `bb_unop` arms (extend the GZ-11+ pattern); (c) real-arithmetic binops (`rung17`/`rung19`/`rung26` `^`/real `*`); then the bigger rungs — generator-operand binops (Fig-1 native, m3/m4) and `rt_call_builtin` (find/upto/many/any native). GZ-DEFER (EVAL/CODE/`*P`, `test_sno_3.c` model) remains open.

**PREV (SCRIP):** `a2a606b` GZ-11+ mode-2 — THREE generator-correctness fixes closing the named binop/`to`
cluster + `proc_locals` accumulation (jcon `ir_a_Binop` / `ir_a_ToBy`). Mode-2 ORACLE ONLY (`bb_exec.c` +
`lower.c`; emitter UNTOUCHED → m3/m4 flat-chain byte-identical, verified `every write(1 to 3)` m2==m3). 2 files
(+74/−14). Rebased CONFLICT-CLEAN twice onto parallel SNOBOL4 `a06b2a1`/`706d665` (PB-RB-3 BB_MATCH) and Prolog
`f5170a0` (PLG-9e) — disjoint files, FACT-rule isolation held. corpus `test_icon_all_rungs` 110→114 PASS.

**PREV (SCRIP):** `c353d68` GZ-11+ mode-2 RELATIONAL BINOP GENERATOR-TRANSPARENCY (jcon `ir_a_Binop`). A
FALSE relational comparison (`rel_fail`) is not the binop's failure — per jcon a relop is generator-transparent
and re-seeks the next operand value. The postfix `IR_BINOP` exec arm (`bb_exec.c`) re-enters the generator
operand's chain head (`operand_aux[1]`=right, then `[0]`=left) on `rel_fail` instead of returning ω; `v_binop`
already wired right.failure→left.resume so a both-generators case cascades and a drained chain reaches the
binop's own ω; with no generator operand (e.g. `3 < 2`) it collapses to plain failure. Fixed `2 < (1 to 4)`→3,4
and gen-on-left `(1 to 5) > 3`→3,3 (Icon relops return the right operand). **GATES:** corpus 107→110. Pushed;
rebased CONFLICT-CLEAN onto upstream `202bbba`. (This session's HEAD extended this exact mechanism to relops
over NESTED binops via `gen_resume_target`, plus generator-bounded `to` and binop variable re-deref.)
