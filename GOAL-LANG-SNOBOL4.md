# GOAL-LANG-SNOBOL4.md — SNOBOL4 Frontend Ladder

**Repo:** one4all
**Done when:** beauty.sno self-hosts cleanly under all three modes (--ir-run,
--sm-run, --jit-run). Full corpus PASS count matches SPITBOL oracle.

**Cross-pollination:** Every bug fix in interp.c, sm_lower.c, or bb_boxes.c
immediately benefits Icon, Prolog, Raku, Snocone, Rebus sessions.
Share fixes via main — no branches.

## Session Setup

```bash
bash /home/claude/one4all/scripts/install_system_packages.sh
bash /home/claude/one4all/scripts/build_scrip.sh
bash /home/claude/one4all/scripts/build_spitbol_oracle.sh
bash /home/claude/one4all/scripts/build_csnobol4_oracle.sh
```

Gate after setup:
```bash
bash /home/claude/one4all/scripts/test_smoke_snobol4.sh          # PASS=7
bash /home/claude/one4all/scripts/test_smoke_unified_broker.sh   # PASS=49
```

## Architecture reminder

```
.sno -> sno_parse() -> Program* [LANG_SNO]
    --ir-run  -> execute_program() -> interp_eval()   tree-walk
    --sm-run  -> sm_lower() -> SM_Program -> sm_interp_run()
    --jit-run -> sm_lower() -> SM_Program -> sm_codegen() -> sm_jit_run()
```

Pattern matching uses BB_SCAN. Every pattern primitive is a bb_box_fn in bb_boxes.c.
Oracle: SPITBOL x64 at /home/claude/x64/bin/sbl.

## scrip-monitor Protocol

Step 1 (--monitor) runs EVERY iteration, unconditionally.
Steps 2 and 3 only if Step 1 shows DIVERGE or IR vs CSN.

```bash
# Build once per session:
bash /home/claude/one4all/scripts/build_csnobol4_archive.sh
make -C /home/claude/one4all scrip-monitor CSN_A=/home/claude/csnobol4/libcsnobol4.a

# Step 1 -- ALWAYS:
BEAUTY=/home/claude/corpus/programs/snobol4/beauty
SNO_LIB=$BEAUTY /home/claude/one4all/scrip-monitor --monitor \
    $BEAUTY/beauty_${DRIVER}_driver.sno < /dev/null 2>&1 | grep -A 10 "DIVERGE\|IR vs CSN"

# Step 2 -- only if Step 1 shows problem: SPITBOL diff
SNO_LIB=$BEAUTY /home/claude/x64/bin/sbl -b $BEAUTY/beauty_${DRIVER}_driver.sno > /tmp/spitbol.out 2>/dev/null
SNO_LIB=$BEAUTY timeout 30 /home/claude/one4all/scrip --ir-run $BEAUTY/beauty_${DRIVER}_driver.sno > /tmp/scrip.out 2>/dev/null
diff /tmp/spitbol.out /tmp/scrip.out | head -40

# Step 3 -- only if Step 1 shows problem: OUTPUT probe -> fix -> rebuild -> repeat
# Rebuild: make scrip && make scrip-monitor CSN_A=...
# Broker gate: bash scripts/test_smoke_unified_broker.sh
```

## Rung ladder

### Phase 1 -- IR-run  DONE (SN-1..SN-5, SN-14, SN-15, SN-16, SN-19)
### Phase 2 -- SM-run  (SN-7..SN-9, gated on SN-6)
### Phase 3 -- JIT-run (SN-10..SN-12, gated on SN-9)

- [x] **SN-20** -- NAM push/pop self-unwinding (`*var-holds-DT_E` thaw folded
      into `name_commit_value` at SN-21e).  HEAD `8964586e`.

- [x] **SN-21** -- Unified `NAME_t` + flat NAM stack; one lvalue concept,
      one push/pop API, one `bb_cap` box for `.` / `$` / `NRETURN` / `*fn()`.
      Ladder SN-21a..e landed across multiple sessions; full design rationale
      in the SN-21a..e commit messages.  HEAD `8964586e` (SN-21e).

- [x] **SN-17** -- Porter stemmer gap closed.  Done 2026-04-19.
      `--ir-run` and `--sm-run` both at **100.00%** / 23531 on porter.sno.
      Sub-rungs landed: SN-17a (SM_PAT_USERCALL opcode, commit `f2cf3494`)
      and SN-17d (FAIL propagation in `bb_usercall`, commit `9d9d2dd3`).
      SN-17b and SN-17c deferred — they were not required for the Porter
      fix after SN-17a routed both modes through the same XATP /
      `bb_usercall` path, making SN-17d a single-file fix that landed in
      both modes simultaneously.

  **History preserved below for the next session that encounters a
  similar shared-path / parallel-switch question:**

  **Measured at HEAD `8964586e` (pre-SN-17):**
  - `--ir-run`: 19674 / 23531 matched = **83.60%**
  - `--sm-run`: 14317 / 23531 matched = **60.84%**
  - Broad corpus: PASS=223/225 (unchanged).

  **Root cause** (isolated 2026-04-19): bare `*fn()` guard patterns do not
  propagate FAIL.  Minimal repro (no `$`, no alternation needed):
  ```snobol4
                 DEFINE('g_fail()')
  g_fail         g_fail = FAIL :(RETURN)
                 'abate' RTAB(3) 'ate' *g_fail() RPOS(0) :F(no)S(yes)
  ```
  SPITBOL: NO MATCH (sweeps positions, guard fails at each).
  scrip `--ir-run`: spurious MATCH.

  Porter's `*g_m_gt_0()`, `*g_vis()`, etc. always silently pass → every
  rule fires → over-stripping (`abate → ab` vs SPITBOL's `abat`).

  **First-pass fix attempt** (reverted, not committed): rewriting
  `bb_usercall` in `stmt_exec.c` to eagerly invoke `g_user_call_hook` at
  α caught the call but exposed a second layer — `g_fn = FAIL` returns
  `DT_P` wrapping `XFAIL`, not `DT_FAIL`.  The check needs both.

  **Pivot — three-mode audit, 2026-04-19:**

  Bug is doubled across modes; no shared execution code means each mode
  has its own version of the problem:

  | Mode | State of bare `*fn()` | Path |
  |------|----------------------|------|
  | `--ir-run` | calls deferred to commit time via NM_CALL, return discarded | stmt_exec.c `bb_usercall` |
  | `--sm-run` | no opcode — lowering drops the node entirely | sm_lower.c (missing) |
  | `--jit-run` | inherits sm-run's hole | sm_codegen.c (missing) |

  **Duplication found** (every site must be edited in lockstep):

  1. `stmt_exec.c:bb_build` (35 XKIND cases) ↔ `bb_build.c:bb_build_binary_node`
     (24 XKIND cases) — parallel dispatchers; bb_build.c returns NULL to
     fall back to stmt_exec.c for unimplemented kinds.
  2. `sm_interp.c` (63 SM opcode cases) ↔ `sm_codegen.c` (52 `h_*` handlers)
     — pattern-construction handlers are line-for-line copies around the
     shared `pat_*` constructors in `snobol4_pattern.c`.
  3. `snobol4_pattern.c` `pat_*` constructors ARE shared — the unification
     we have is at the node-construction level; dispatch is where it splits.

  **Fresh rung ladder — SN-17a..d:**

- [x] **SN-17a** -- Add `SM_PAT_USERCALL` opcode.  Done 2026-04-19.
      - `sm_prog.h`: opcode added after `SM_PAT_CAPTURE_FN`.
      - `sm_lower.c`: `case E_DEFER:` now detects `E_DEFER(E_FNC)` in pattern
        context and emits `SM_PAT_USERCALL s="FNAME" args="..."`.  Previous
        behavior fell through `lower_expr → SM_CALL → SM_PAT_DEREF`, which
        invoked fn **once at build time** and treated the return as a pattern
        (no per-position sweep).
      - `sm_interp.c`: `case SM_PAT_USERCALL:` pushes `pat_user_call(fname, NULL, 0)`.
      - `sm_codegen.c`: `h_pat_usercall` handler + registered in `g_handlers`.
      - `sm_prog.c`: added to opnames[] and `sm_prog_print` switch.
      - `pat_user_call()` already existed in `snobol4_pattern.c:393` (builds
        XATP node) — SN-17a just wired an SM opcode to it.
      - Arg-name stash in `a[2].s` is emitted but not yet consumed (left NULL
        into `pat_user_call`); named-args resolution lands in SN-17d with the
        FAIL-propagation fix.

      **Porter measurement (oracle: `paste` agree-count / 23531):**
      - `--ir-run`: 19674 → 19639  (slight drift; see note)
      - `--sm-run`: 14317 → **19639**  (+5322, 60.84% → 83.46%)
      - The two modes now **converge** — both produce identical output.
        This is the shape SN-17d targets ("both match SPITBOL on abate…")
        minus the final FAIL-propagation piece.
      - Gates: Smoke PASS=7, Broker PASS=48, Broad corpus PASS=223/225
        (same two fails: expr_eval, demo_claws5 — pre-existing, SN-6).

      **Note on the `--ir-run` 35-line drift:** before SN-17a the two modes
      disagreed because `--sm-run` took the broken `SM_CALL→SM_PAT_DEREF`
      path.  `--ir-run` had its own (different) wrongness via `bb_usercall`
      on XATP, and the two wrongnesses happened to produce 35 ref-matching
      lines that `--sm-run` didn't.  Now both modes route through
      `pat_user_call → XATP → bb_usercall`; the 35 lines moved from
      `--ir-run`-accidentally-right to `--both`-equally-wrong.  SN-17d
      will recover them in both modes simultaneously.

- [~] **SN-17b** -- Unify `bb_build` dispatch.  **DEFERRED**: inspection
      at SN-17a found that stmt_exec.c's `bb_build` and bb_build.c's
      `bb_build_binary_node` produce *different* artifacts (C closure
      `bb_node_t` vs native x86 trampoline `bb_box_fn`), not parallel
      dispatchers answering the same question.  They share the XKIND
      switch skeleton but each case emits a fundamentally different
      object.  Neither goal-file option fits cleanly: (i) with a mode
      flag forces every case body to branch on mode, reducing clarity;
      (ii) a single function-pointer table can't carry two return
      types.  More importantly, SN-17d landed with a single-file fix
      to `bb_usercall` — unification was not required to get the
      Porter fix into both modes, because SN-17a had already routed
      them through the same XATP / bb_usercall path.  Keep as optional
      cleanup; not on the SN-7 critical path.

- [~] **SN-17c** -- Unify SM opcode handlers.  **DEFERRED** for the
      same reason as SN-17b: the duplication cost was paid once in
      SN-17a (adding SM_PAT_USERCALL in sm_interp.c + sm_codegen.c)
      and SN-17d didn't need it.  Still a defensible cleanup, but
      not required for SN-7.

- [x] **SN-17d** -- Fix `*fn()` FAIL propagation.  Done 2026-04-19.
      Single-file change to `bb_usercall` in `stmt_exec.c`: invoke
      `g_user_call_hook` eagerly at α and propagate FAIL directly
      (both `DT_FAIL` and `DT_P` wrapping `XFAIL` shapes handled).
      No NAM push needed — nothing to defer for bare `*fn()`.  The
      `. / $` capture forms still use NAME_push_callcap via bb_cap /
      XCALLCAP (untouched).

      **Porter measurement (paste-agree / 23531):**
      - `--ir-run`: 19639 → **23531 (100.00%)**
      - `--sm-run`: 19639 → **23531 (100.00%)**
      - Mode agreement: 23531 / 23531 (both modes byte-identical).
      - Gates: Smoke PASS=7, Broker PASS=49 (+1 — pre-existing 48/49
        drift was the same bug; this fix repairs it), Broad corpus
        PASS=223/225 (same two pre-existing fails).

  **Reproduction commands:**
  ```bash
  cd /home/claude/corpus/programs/snobol4/demo
  /home/claude/one4all/scrip --ir-run porter.sno < porter.input | diff - porter.ref | wc -l
  /home/claude/one4all/scrip --sm-run porter.sno < porter.input | diff - porter.ref | wc -l
  ```

  **Minimal repro stashed** at `/tmp/probe_plain.sno` (this session only
  — not committed; recreate from the snippet above if the container
  resets).  Side-probes: `/tmp/probe_nopattern.sno`, `/tmp/probe_guard2.sno`.

- [ ] **SN-6** -- Full corpus: PASS=223/225 default, 224/225 --ir-run.
  Remaining: `expr_eval` (two separate bugs — see below), `demo_claws5`
  (GOAL-SNO-CLAWS5.md).
  ```bash
  bash /home/claude/one4all/scripts/test_interp_broad_corpus_and_beauty.sh
  ```

  **expr_eval diagnostic (measured at `8964586e`):**
  - `--ir-run`: 4/5 inputs → `snobol4:0: error: parse error: syntax error`.
    That is the SNOBOL4 *frontend parser*, not a pattern-match error —
    `EVAL(op arg)` is probably compiling the evaluated string as SNOBOL4
    statements.  The 2 lines that do parse produce wrong values:
    `(1+2)*3` → `3` (expected 9), `-3+10` → `10` (expected 7).  Two
    layered bugs: EVAL call path + operator precedence / Pop() ordering.
  - `--sm-run`: 5/5 → `Bad input, try again`.  The top-level
    `POS(0) expr RPOS(0)` pattern fails for every input.  Recursive
    `primary = constant | '(' *expr ')'` via bb_cap / NM_CALL is the
    likely fault line.

  Not DT_E (verified identical at pre-SN-21e).

- [ ] **SN-7** -- beauty.sno self-host: 6 drivers × 3 modes = 18 combos,
  diff=0 vs SPITBOL. Gate: smoke PASS=7, broker PASS=49, all 18 diff=0.

## Current state

**HEAD:** one4all @ `9d9d2dd3` (SN-17d). Gates: Smoke 7, Broker 49.
Porter `--ir-run` and `--sm-run` both at **100.00%** / 23531,
byte-identical to SPITBOL ref.  Broad corpus: PASS=223/225 (unchanged;
SN-6 remaining).

**Next step:** SN-6 — close the last two broad-corpus fails (expr_eval
has two layered bugs; demo_claws5 tracked in GOAL-SNO-CLAWS5.md).  With
SN-17 closed, beauty self-host (SN-7) is now the gating milestone for
declaring the SNOBOL4 Frontend Ladder done.
